   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must

   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
   copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
   Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms

   this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,

   or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
   liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
   from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not
   apply to You.

   Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
   a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances
   to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
   Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor
   and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the
   Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein,
   and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another
   written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S.
   copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
   treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section
   1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms
   and conditions.

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a
   patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a
   patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the
   Original Work with other software or hardware).

   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17
   U.S.C. ¤ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and
   international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
   damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
   its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
   fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal
   of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable.

   (( 14) ))??
   Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether

((  AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1, March 2002 ))??

Copyright © 2002 Affero Inc.

510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA

This license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright
(C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission.
Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of
Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
(Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This
General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
   terms of this Affero General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to
   any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

      __1__ If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users
      through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user
      interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request
      transmission to that user of the Program's complete source code, you must
      not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work
      based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all
      users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request
      immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your
      modified version or other derivative work.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero
   General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
   in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
   problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program
   does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
   ever published by Affero, Inc.

   You may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under
   any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License
   version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms
   and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write
   to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
   the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
   software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in
alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software
are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case
of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU
General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public
access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It
requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
access to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   __1__ Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   __1__ Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used
   among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those

   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   __1__ Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
   provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
      and giving a relevant date.

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
      notices".

      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
   other parts of the aggregate.

   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
      network server at no charge.

      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You
      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or
      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.

      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall
   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to
   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed
   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
   the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   __1__ Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or

      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
   terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
   apply either way.

   __1__ Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants
   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
   to do so.

   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
   with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   __1__ Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to s ue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
   extend the patent

   license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual
   knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
   in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would
   infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
   reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may

   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
   collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
   Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
   would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   __1__ Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
   Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
   with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
   interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
   version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server
   at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
   copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the
   Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General
   Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
   resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
   which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
   governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
   later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
   not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you
   may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
   GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
   of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
   for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   __1__ Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   __1__ Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
   all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
   assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
   fee.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

__30__
//**
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(( (at your option) ))??
any
later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along
with this program. If not, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,
you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.
For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a
"Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways
you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>. ))??

(( ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1.0 ))??

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE
("LICENSE"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT
SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. "LICENSED WORK" AND "RECIPIENT"
ARE DEFINED BELOW.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This License is "adaptive", and the generic version or another
version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine
your rights and obligations under this License. You must read the specific
Adaptive Public License that you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain
terms are defined at the outset by the Initial Contributor.

See Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying
this License to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this
License. For example, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of

      "INDEPENDENT MODULE" means a separate module of software and/or data that
      is not a derivative work of or copied from the Licensed Work or any
      portion thereof. In addition, a module does not qualify as an Independent
      Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the module: (a) is
      embedded in the Licensed Work; (b) is included by reference in the
      Licensed Work other than by a function call or a class reference; or (c)
      must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file
      directory or subdirectory actually containing files making up the Licensed
      Work.

      (( 1.8. ))??
      "INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR" means the Person or entity identified as the Initial
      Contributor in the notice required by Part 1 of Exhibit A.

      and/or additions to:

         (( (a) ))??
         the Initial Work;

         (( (b) ))??
         any other Subsequent Work; or

         (( c ))??
         to any combination of the Initial Work and any such other Subsequent
         Work;

         where such changes and/or additions originate from a Subsequent
         Contributor. A Subsequent Work will "originate" from a Subsequent
         Contributor if the Subsequent Work was a result of efforts by such
         Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such Subsequent
         Contributor's behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is
         engaged by or under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For
         greater certainty, a Subsequent Work expressly excludes and shall not
         capture within its meaning any Independent Module.

      (( 1.19. ))??
      "SUPPLEMENT FILE" means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a

         Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby
         grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
         copyright license to:

            (( (i) ))??
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
            perform, distribute and sublicense the Initial Work; and

            (( (ii) ))??
            reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and
            sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;

            in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications,
            on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.

         (( (b) ))??
         Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor
         hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
         copyright license to:

            (( (i) ))??
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
            perform, distribute and sublicense the Subsequent Work of such
            Subsequent Contributor; and

            (( (ii) ))??
            reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and
            sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;

            in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications,
            on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.

      (( 2.2. ))??
      PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.

         (( (a) ))??
         This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever
         from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any
         Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed
         or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial
         Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent
         terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this
         is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made
         available under the License without any patent license (the
         "PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE").

         (( (b) ))??
         However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make
         available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work;
         or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which
         includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any
         Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License
         which includes a patent license (the "PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE") by
         selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in
         paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial
         Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such
         future copies under this License.

         (( c ))??
         If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial
         Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the
         Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this
         License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from
         Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon
         the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all
         Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any
         other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which
         includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with
         respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and
         availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications
         made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the
         License without any patent license.

         (( (d) ))??
         Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the
         Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License
         having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work
         (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a
         Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof)
         shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or
         distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only
         the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which
         shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of
         Exhibit A.

      (( 2.3. ))??
      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.

      Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and
      each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
      forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is
      provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or
      Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor,
      Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to
      Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
      intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed
      Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any
      other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without
      limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is
      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is
      Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Licensed Work.

      (( 2.4. ))??
      RESERVATION.

      Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
      copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of
      Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as
      expressly stated herein.

   (( 3. ))??
   DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.

         (( (a) ))??
         A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's
         Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The
         aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time
         after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60)
         days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's
         Subsequent Work.

         (( (b) ))??
         All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with
         the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License
         (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement
         File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular,
         this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in
         a file called "license.txt." In addition, the License Notice in Part 5
         of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code
         files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License
         Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the
         Licensed Work.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.

      A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion
      thereof, in Executable form (an "EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION") to any third
      party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the
      Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy
      of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is
      fulfilled:

         (( (a) ))??
         The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for
         the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source
         Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable
         Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or

         (( (b) ))??
         The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer,
         valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party
         under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of
         physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
         copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable
         Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain
         available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution
         Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as
         a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.

      For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed
      Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form,
      whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work
      or Independent Modules, or in some other combination.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.

      When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof,
      available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available
      under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each
      copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is
      conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater
      clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the
      Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for
      the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more
      than the cost of physically performing source distribution.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.

      Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5
      of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each
      Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor,
      if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not
      possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
      structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where
      a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.

      Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally
      within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work,
      including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications
      for internal use within Recipient's own corporation or organization
      (collectively, "INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS"). The Recipient shall have no
      obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any
      such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such
      internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All
      Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a
      Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the
      terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such
      Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be
      deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications
      distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work
      originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first
      such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be
      distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the
      terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      INDEPENDENT MODULES.

      This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial
      Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and
      such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or
      more separate license agreements.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      LARGER WORKS.

      Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by
      combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the
      terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more
      products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case
      may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled
      for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.

      (( 3.8. ))??
      DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.

         (( (a) ))??
         Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where
         the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor)
         must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that
         Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in
         accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that
         such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to
         that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements
         are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no
         requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they
         make resulting in Subsequent Works.

         (( (b) ))??
         The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add
         to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the "EARLIER
         DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS") for documenting changes resulting in
         Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File
         distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the
         Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the "NEW
         DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS") for documenting such changes.

         (( c ))??
         Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any
         Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an "Earlier
         LICENSED COPY") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose,
         with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the
         Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements.
         Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description
         Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any
         copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File
         having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New
         Description Requirements.

         (( (d) ))??
         For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is
         to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must
         document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in
         Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to
         increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of
         this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and
         obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis
         for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to
         correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1
         of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of
         any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed
         Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting
         changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.

         (( (e) ))??
         An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and
         contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of
         Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding
         on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this
         Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor
         includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the
         Initial Work distributed under this License.

      (( 3.9. ))??
      USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.

      The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to
      endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed
      Work, without prior written permission.

      (( 3.10. ))??
      LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.

         (( (a) ))??
         As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that
         its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort
         invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may
         include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time
         an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent
         Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent
         display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur
         (the "ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION"). The Attribution Information must be
         included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater
         certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File
         that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable
         program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not
         a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably
         modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require
         Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution
         Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial
         Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one
         digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL
         (collectively, the "ATTRIBUTION LIMITS").

         (( (b) ))??
         If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out
         in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for
         Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial
         Contributor.

         (( c ))??
         Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or
         trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed
         with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial
         Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial
         Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as
         expressly set out in this License.

      (( 3.11. ))??
      For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained
      within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the
      description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision
      in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or
      amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be
      deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.

      (( 4.1. ))??
      COMMERCIAL SERVICES.

      A Recipient ("COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT") may choose to offer, and to charge a
      fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
      (collectively, "SERVICES") to one or more other Recipients or
      Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that
      Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other
      Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are
      offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient
      use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or
      Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this
      License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of
      the other terms of this License, including without limitation the
      obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing
      any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such
      distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more
      than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable
      distribution (as the case may be).

      (( 4.2. ))??
      INDEMNITY.

      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
      with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
      License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work,
      the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial
      product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
      liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the
      Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services,
      such Distributor ("COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR") hereby agrees to defend and
      indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case
      an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against any losses, damages and costs
      (collectively "LOSSES") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
      actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the
      extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
      connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a
      commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The
      obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating
      to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
      qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial
      Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial
      Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in,
      the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party
      may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   (( 5. ))??
   VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

      (( 5.1. ))??
      NEW VERSIONS.

      The Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 5.2. ))??
      EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.

      Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by
      Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient
      may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However,
      if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor,
      then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with
      the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further
      reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public
      performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in
      connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial
      Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed
      Work

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      GENERAL DISCLAIMER.

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS

      CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
      THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE
      DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY
      SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
      LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER

      (( 6.2. ))??
      RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS.

      of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks
      associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but
      not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
      applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
      unavailability or interruption of operations.

      express terms herein.

      (( 7.2. ))??
      Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time.

      (( 7.3. ))??

      a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is
      in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure
      such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of
      any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any
      rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this
      License.

      (( 7.4. ))??
      Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular
      Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other
      License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the
      Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient
      under a copy of this License (in each case, an "Other License" and in
      plural, "Other Licenses") shall survive any such termination of this
      License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under
      such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees
      (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of
      this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed
      Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their
      respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature,
      must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.

      (( 7.5. ))??
      Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular
      Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together
      with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and
      enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination.

      IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR
      AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,

      (( 9.1. ))??
      This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
      laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A,
      without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a
      legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the
      action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any
      litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing
      Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing
      Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York.

      (( 9.2. ))??
      The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not
      exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and
      claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or
      otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way
      relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality,

      embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list
      of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce's
      Table of Denial Orders. By using the Original Code, You represent and
      warrant that You are not located in, under control of, or a national or
      resident of any such country or on any such list.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this
      License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any
      other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
      a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this
      License.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.8 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient

   use of the Original Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire
   risk. THE ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR
   SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF

   AS "APPLE") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
   CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A

   (( 9. ))??
   Liability.

      (( 9.1 ))??
      Infringement. If any portion of, or functionality implemented by, the
      Original Code becomes the subject of a claim of infringement, Apple may,
      at its option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary for Apple and
      You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b) modify the Affected
      Original Code so that it is no longer infringing; or (c) suspend Your
      rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and distribute the Affected
      Original Code until a final determination of the claim is made by a court
      or governmental administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and Apple
      lifts the suspension as set forth below. Such suspension of rights will be
      effective immediately upon Apple's posting of a notice to such effect on
      the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License. Upon
      such final determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the
      payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction, modification,
      sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original Code, Apple will
      lift the suspension of rights to the Affected Original Code by posting a
      notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for
      implementation of this License. If Apple suspends Your rights to Affected
      Original Code, nothing in this License shall be construed to restrict You,
      at Your option and subject to applicable law, from replacing the Affected
      Original Code with non-infringing code or independently negotiating for
      necessary rights from such third party.

      (( 9.2 ))??
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR
      ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
      OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL
      CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT,
      WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE,
      EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND
      NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no
      event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages under this
      License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac OS X Server" or any
   other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple
   Marks") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived
   from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at
   all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are
   posted at http:/www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

   (( 11. ))??
   Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the
   Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple
   Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically
   subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
   such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
   contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple's
   development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution
   of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
         term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Apple.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
      of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in
      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party
      will be liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any
      sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of either party.

      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether
      expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may

      develop, produce, market or distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this
      License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any
      other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
      a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this
      License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rediges en anglais.

         You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly
         available under the terms of this License, including the license grants
         set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered
         Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment,
         whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code
         of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web
         site); and

         (( (d) ))??
         if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You
         must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in
         related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
         available under the terms of this License with information on how and
         where to obtain such Source Code.

      (( 2.3 ))??
      You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each
      Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
      Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
      Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each
      Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
      license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
      Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Covered Code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License:

      (( (a) ))??
      You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive,
      royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other
      intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by
      You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy

      You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable

      distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through multiple tiers of
      distribution.

   (( 4. ))??
   Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any
   portion thereof.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no
   other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
   Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
   Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
   more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
   behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
   Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
   defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of
   any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of
   this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
   version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
   version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
   subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than
   Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
   under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
   pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may
   contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
   incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
   use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire
   risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR

   EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY
   RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH
   YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE

   CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE
   WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE,
   AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A
   WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in
   the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
   systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the
   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
   environmental damage.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE
   OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,
   WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
   PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to
   You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
   this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??

   trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac OS X Server",
   "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks or trade
   names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark or
   trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Apple Marks may be used to
   endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as

   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and

   not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole
   discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or
   on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to
   license them at all.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         against Apple.

      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination

      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software

      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or amongYou, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent
      to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
      otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple
      and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by

      otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party

      is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Covered Code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving

   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any
   portion thereof.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no

   Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
   Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
   more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
   behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
   Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
   defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of
   any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of

   YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE
   COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED
   CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE

   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
   environmental damage.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE
   OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,
   WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
   PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to
   You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
   this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Apple",
   ((Apple Computer))??
   "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming
   Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names
   belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service
   mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use
   any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the
   Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original
   Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all
   times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
   http:/www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

   (( 11. ))??
   Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and
   interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on
   behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will
   not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole
   discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or
   on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to
   license them at all.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
         term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for
         patent infringement against You in that instance.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been
      properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not
      limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
      Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent
      to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
      otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rédigés en anglais.

((Copyright __20__))??
))??

(( NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by
the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those
of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this
license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License
to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices
and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except
for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description
of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity
that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a
work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first
paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the
appropriate country. ))??

   (( 0. ))??
   Subject Matter

   This License applies to the computer program known as "Aladdin Ghostscript."
   The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted
   work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the "Licensor"). Please
   note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as "GNU
   Ghostscript" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial
   licensing from Artifex Software Inc.

   A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
   of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such
   as a translation or a modification.

   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
   YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED
   ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
   DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED
   BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
   DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

   (( 1. ))??
   Licenses.

   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply
   with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further,
   that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

      (( (a) ))??
      You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
      Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any
      medium.

      (( (b) ))??
      You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
      distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

   (( 2. ))??
   Restrictions.

   This license is subject to the following restrictions:

      (( (a) ))??
      Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
      commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is
      made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment
      for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service
      related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that
      includes a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,
      and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following
      methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves
      be a violation of this restriction:

         (( (i) ))??
         Posting the Program on a public access information storage and
         retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
         information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not
         content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the
         same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
         to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other
         product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under
         this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and
         that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an
         exhaustive enumeration.)

         (( (ii) ))??
         Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided
         that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and
         verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be
         redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that
         such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying
         documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of
         such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media.
         (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
         distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included
         in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

      (( (b) ))??
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the
      Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope.
      Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output
      produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if
      its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
      been made by running the Program).

      (( c ))??
      You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work
      that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
      derived from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):

         (( (i) ))??
         If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry
         prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's files
         and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified,
         you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file,
         including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
         purpose of the change;

         (( (ii) ))??
         You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to
         all third parties under the terms of this License;

         (( (iii) ))??
         If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
         cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or
         display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
         warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the
         Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to
         view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if
         the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an
         announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an "About box",
         the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same
         circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not
         normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print
         an announcement.);

         (( (iv) ))??
         You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding
         machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used
         for software interchange. The source code for a work means the
         preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
         executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all
         modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
         plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
         executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is
         normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
         components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
         which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of
         that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;

         (( (v) ))??
         If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work,
         such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a
         prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License
         and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the
         License on the distribution medium;

         (( (vi) ))??
         You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise
         of the rights granted herein.

         If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
         equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering
         equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts
         as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
         compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Reservation of Rights.

   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
   sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   (( 4. ))??
   Other Restrictions.

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
   permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
   License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
   License.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
   LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
   PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
   AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 6. ))??
   General.

   This License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
   excluding choice of law rules.

   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that
   part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law,
   and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

   For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
   RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are
   acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:

   If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the Program and
   its documentation are classified as "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation" respectively and, pursuant to
   DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its
   documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or
   agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as
   "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
   documentation" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the
   Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with
   the terms of this License.

   Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply
   this License to their own work, as long as the entire License
   (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no
   changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first
   paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work
   to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that

   This License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it
   places restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically
   including sale of the Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and
   supports the philosophy of the Open Source Definition, and shares the
   desire of the GNU project to keep licensed software freely
   redistributable in both source and object form, we feel that Open
   Source licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software from
   being compensated proportionately when others profit financially from
   their work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive,
   redistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the
   Open Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so,
   while retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make
   those who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products
   pay for the privilege of doing so.

0. Subject Matter

   This License applies to the computer program known as "AFPL
   Ghostscript." The "Program", below, refers to such program. The
   Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by artofcode
   LLC, located in Benicia, California (the "Licensor"). Please note that
   AFPL Ghostscript is neither the program known as "GNU Ghostscript" nor
   the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from
   Artifex Software Inc.

   A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
   derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States
   Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.

   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE
   PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND
   ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING
   THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE
   GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS
   DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT
   ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE
   PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.

   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you
   comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and
   provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this
   License with the Program:
   (a)
          You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of
          the Program's source code as you receive it throughout the
          world, in any medium.
   (b)
          You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program
          and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any
          medium.

2. Restrictions.

   This license is subject to the following restrictions:
   (a)
          Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by
          a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if
          any payment is made in connection with such distribution,
          whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or
          indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the
          Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a
          copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,
          and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities).
          The following methods of distribution involving payment shall
          not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:
        (i)
               Posting the Program on a public access information storage
               and retrieval service for which a fee is received for
               retrieving information (such as an on-line service),
               provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the
               fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of
               information consisting of random data) and that access to
               the service and to the Program is available independent of
               any other product or service. An example of a service that
               does not fall under this section is an on-line service
               that is operated by a company and that is only available
               to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
               enumeration.)
        (ii)
               Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable
               media, provided that the files containing the Program are
               reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all
               information on such media be redistributable for
               non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such
               media are distributed by themselves (except for
               accompanying documentation) independent of any other
               product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM,
               magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not
               intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
               distribution that does not fall under this section is a
               CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an
               exhaustive enumeration.)
   (b)
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of
          the Program are not subject to this License and they are
          outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is
          not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the
          Program is subject to this license only if its contents
          constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
          been made by running the Program).
   (c)
          You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to
          any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in
          part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
          thereof ("the Work"):
        (i)
               If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work
               to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified
               the Program's files and the date of any change. In each
               source file that you have modified, you must include a
               prominent notice that you have modified the file,
               including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the
               date and purpose of the change;
        (ii)
               You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at
               no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
               License;
        (iii)
               If the Work normally reads commands interactively when
               run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences
               operation, to print or display an announcement including
               an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
               no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty).
               Such notice must also state that users may redistribute
               the Work only under the conditions of this License and
               tell the user how to view the copy of this License
               included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is
               interactive but normally prints or displays such an
               announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an
               "About box", the Work is required to print or display the
               notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program
               itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
               announcement, the Work is not required to print an
               announcement.);
        (iv)
               You must accompany the Work with the complete
               corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a
               medium customarily used for software interchange. The
               source code for a work means the preferred form of the
               work for making modifications to it. For an executable
               work, complete source code means all the source code for
               all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
               definition files, plus the scripts used to control
               compilation and installation of the executable code. If
               you distribute with the Work any component that is
               normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
               with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
               the operating system on which the executable runs, you
               must also distribute the source code of that component if
               you have it and are allowed to do so;
        (v)
               If you distribute any written or printed material at all
               with the Work, such material must include either a written
               copy of this License, or a prominent written indication
               that the Work is covered by this License and written
               instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of
               the License on the distribution medium;
        (vi)
               You may not impose any further restrictions on the
               recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
   equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts
   as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.

  3. Reservation of Rights.

   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth
   herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
   Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

  4. Other Restrictions.

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

  5. Limitations.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
   NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
   WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
   NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
   LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
   TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
   PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  6. General.

   This License is governed by the laws of the State of California,
   U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.

   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,
   that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with
   the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

   For United States Government users, the Program is provided with
   RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States
   Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,
   the following apply:

     If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the
     Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial
     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"
     respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government
     is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with
     the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD,
     the Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial
     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"
     respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is
     acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
     terms of this License.

(( TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION ))??

   (( 1. ))??
   Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
      distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of __1__ document.

      __1__ shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the
      copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
      entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with
      that entity. For the purposes of __1__ definition, "control" means (
      (( i || properties || k ))
      ) the
      power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
      entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
      percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
      ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
      permissions granted by __1__ License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,
      and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
      or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled
      object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media
      (( types || pointer ))

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
      form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice
      that is included in or attached to the work
      (( (an example is provided in the Appendix below). ))??

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
      that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
      revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as
      a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of __1__ License,
      Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
      merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
      Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
      version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for

      Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
      purposes of __1__ definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
      verbal, or written
      ((communication || token))
      sent to the Licensor or its
      representatives, including but not limited to
      ((communication || token))
      on
      ((electronic))??

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??

   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
      such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
      modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
      Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard

      Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.

   charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
   larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
   be considered part of this Package.

(( The Artistic License 2.0 ))??

((Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.))??

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may
be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the
Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that
Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you
should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.

Definitions

   "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
   copyright notice for the entire Package.

   "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to
   the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

   "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
   modify the Package.

   "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
   and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may
   consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

   "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
   anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside
   of your company or organization.

   "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package
   or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean
   licensing fees.

   "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
   been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

   "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
   changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

   "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
   Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
   modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

   "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
   files for the Package.

   "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
   other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the
   Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

   (( (1) ))??
   You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified
   Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not
   Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

   (( (2) ))??
   You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version
   of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a
   Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright
   notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies
   may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

   (( (3) ))??
   You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
   made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
   considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
   License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

   (( (4) ))??
   You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a
   Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
   provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,
   including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,
   executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
   following:

      (( (a) ))??
      make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
      Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder
      may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

      (( (b) ))??
      ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
      user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified
      Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard
      Version.

      (( c ))??
      allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
      Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

         (( (i) ))??
         the Original License or

         (( (ii) ))??
         a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
         redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
         apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
         Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
         be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
         Distributor Fees are allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source

   (( (5) ))??
   You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source,
   provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of
   the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
   distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out
   such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on
   demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or
   cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the
   instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under
   this license.

   (( (6) ))??
   You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
   provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the
   Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package

   (( (7) ))??
   You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
   Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
   provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor
   Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the
   aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and
   Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the
   aggregation.

   (( (8) ))??
   You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to
   embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone
   binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
   Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not
   expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

   (( (9) ))??
   Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend
   or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a
   Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
   Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.

General Provisions

   (( (10) ))??
   Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
   is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the
   Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the
   Package, if you do not accept this license.

   (( (11) ))??
   If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by
   someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
   Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

   (( (12) ))??
   This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark,
   tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

   (( (13) ))??
   This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
   license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
   transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the
   Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you
   institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
   any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date
   that such litigation is filed.

   (( (14) ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty:

   THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND

(( BSD Protection License

February 2002))??

(( Preamble

--------

The Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") license has proven very effective
over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial
and non-commercial products. For programmers whose primary intention is to
improve the general quality of available software, it is arguable that there is
no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used
wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.

This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of
proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and
universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance of standards --
often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network models).

With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public
License, however, the continued success of this role is called into question.
Given that the inclusion of a few lines of "GPL-tainted" work into a larger body
of work will result in restricted distribution -- and given that further work
will likely build upon the "tainted" portions, making them difficult to remove
at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in
order to protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work,
wish to guard against such "GPL-taint".

In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and
selling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against
the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor. While under existing licenses this would
mean not releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license
existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own
(commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for
non-closed distribution.

For the above reasons, we put forth this "BSD Protection License": A license
designed to retain the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works
in a wide variety of settings, both non-commercial and commercial, while
protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that freedom.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification
follow.))??

(( BitTorrent Open Source License

Version 1.0 ))??

This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the BitTorrent
client and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance
releases of that software ("BitTorrent Products") that are distributed by
BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this
License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected
by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may
use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of
this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal
effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not
this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the
Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been approved by Open
Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been dropped.

This License provides that:

   (( 1. ))??
   You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component
   of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several
   different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

   (( 2. ))??
   Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
   Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The
   terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code"
   are defined in the License.)

   (( 3. ))??
   You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
   create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in
   the License.)

   (( 4. ))??
   By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
   agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then
   distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you
   must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
   providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
   liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or
   causes you any injury or damages.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
   fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed
   Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the
   Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case
the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they
do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice.
If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to
fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to
publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that
consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose
to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those
from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the
License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your
convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

License Terms

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
   property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" means any
   additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file
   containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of
   Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term "Licensed Product"
   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any
   Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each
   person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and
   distributed, a Modification (a "Contributor") hereby grants you a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
   property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 3. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the
   Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for
   combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No
   right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License
   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different
   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right
   to license.

   (( 4. ))??
   Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.

      (( a. ))??
      Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition
      for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any
      Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you
      distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without
      limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you
      contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
      future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include
      a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you
      distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter
      or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering
      the additional rights described in Section 4(d).

      (( b. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of
      this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any
      Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you
      distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a
      mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the
      electronic transfer of data (an "Electronic Distribution Mechanism"). The
      Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you
      distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the
      date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
      subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made
      available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( c. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( i. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any
         Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall
         promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been
         obtained.

         (( ii. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API") and you have knowledge of patent licenses
         that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( iii. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are
         your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant
         the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( d. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you
      provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to
      which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe
      recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the
      notice contained in Exhibit A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source
      Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a
      Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
      is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to
      its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
      Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you
      alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor
      as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

      (( e. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product
      as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain
      terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the
      requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you
      include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related
      documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code
      version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms
      that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or
      any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as
      a result of any terms you offer.

      (( f. ))??
      Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g.,
      combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and
      distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you
      select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the
      Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

   (( 5. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then
   you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
   possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from
   adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer
   programming to be able to understand it.

   (( 6. ))??
   Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor
   or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated
   herein by this reference.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of This License.

      (( a. ))??
      New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new
      versions of the License.

      (( b. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a
      particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed
      Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
      by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.

      (( c. ))??
      Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version
      of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software
      that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename
      your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and
      must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this
      License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of
      Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
   AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE
   OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE
   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 9. ))??
   Termination.

      (( a. ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of
      becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that
      are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license.
      Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
      termination of this License, shall survive.

      (( b. ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as
      Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future
      use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent.
      If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
      are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
      claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under
      Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice
      Period.

      (( c. ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( d. ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by
      you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
      termination.

   (( 10. ))??
   Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
   WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE
   LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY
   SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
   EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
   OR PERSONAL INJURY

   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
   SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
   OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY
   NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 11. ))??
   Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party
   is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor
   and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
   Nothing herein is intended or

   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   (( 12. ))??
   U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that
   term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial
   computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such
   terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
   12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
   Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set
   forth herein.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
   provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
   excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any
   litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
   the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California or the Superior
   Court of the County of Santa Clara, California (as appropriate), with venue
   lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
   for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and
   Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation
   concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that
   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 14. ))??
   Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in
   upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
   under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
   version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you
   includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
   control with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the
   power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
   entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
   (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of
   such entity.

   (( 15. ))??
   Glossary. All defined terms in this License that are used in more than one
   Section of this License are repeated here, in alphabetical order, for the
   convenience of the reader. The Section of this License in which each defined
   term is first used is shown in parentheses.

(( BitTorrent Open Source License

Version 1.1 ))??

This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the BitTorrent
client and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance
releases of that software ("BitTorrent Products") that are distributed by
BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this
License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected
by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may
use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of
this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal
effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not
this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the
Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been approved by Open
Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted.

This License provides that:

   (( 1. ))??
   You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an
   aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different
   sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

   (( 2. ))??
   Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
   Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The
   terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code"
   are defined in the License.)

   (( 3. ))??
   You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
   create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in
   the License.)

   (( 4. ))??
   By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
   agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then
   distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you
   must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others free of
   charge and without a royalty.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for
   executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other
   fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such executable
   versions contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications. For
   the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed
   Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material
   Modifications, you may not sell, accept donations or otherwise receive
   compensation for such executable.

   You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
   providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
   liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or
   causes you any injury or damages.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
   fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell, accept donations
   or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed
   Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the
   Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case
the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they
do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice.
If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to
fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to
publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that
consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing

Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection
with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue
to use the license terms in this version of the License for the Licensed Product
that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions of this
License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released
by Licensor after the release of the new version of this License. Only the
Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed
Product.

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your
convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

      of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" means any
   additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file
   containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of
   a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term "Licensed Product"
   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any
   Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By
   application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity
   who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a
   Modification (a "Contributor") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims,
   to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any

      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 3. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the
   Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for
   combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No
   right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License
   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different
   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right
   to license. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you
   hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of
   Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly
   stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing,
   you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor
   or any Contributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement,
   link or other reference to you in any manner or in any media.

   (( 4. ))??
   Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.

      (( a. ))??
      Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition
      for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any
      Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you
      distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without
      limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you
      contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
      future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include
      a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you
      distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter
      or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering
      the additional rights described in Section 4(d).

      (( b. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without charge,
      under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product
      and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you
      distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a
      mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the
      electronic transfer of data (an "Electronic Distribution Mechanism"). The
      Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you
      distribute must remain available for as long as any executable or other
      form of the Licensed Product is distributed by you. You are responsible
      for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( c. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( i. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any
         Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall
         promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been
         obtained.

         (( ii. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API") and you have knowledge of patent licenses
         that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( iii. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are
         your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant
         the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( d. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you
      provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to
      which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe
      recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the
      notice contained in Exhibit A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source
      Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a
      Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
      is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to
      its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
      Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you
      alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor
      as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

      (( e. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product
      as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain
      terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the
      requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you
      include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related
      documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code
      version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms
      that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or
      any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as
      a result of any terms you offer.

      (( f. ))??
      Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g.,
      combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and
      distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you
      select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the
      Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

      (( g. ))??
      Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed Products,
      Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any provision of this
      License to the contrary, by distributing, selling, licensing, sublicensing
      or otherwise making available any Licensed Product, or Modification or
      Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree
      that you may sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or
      otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed
      Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any
      other Contributor, provided that such executable versions (i) contain your
      or another Contributor's material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise
      material Derivative Works. For purposes of this License, an executable
      version of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material
      Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if
      (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third party's
      software programs or other code, and/or the Licensed Product is combined
      with a number of your own or a third party's software programs or code,
      respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute
      material value, functionality or features to the License Product. For the
      avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed
      Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material
      Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work, in each case
      as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or sublicense for a fee,
      accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.
      Additionally, without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding any
      provision of this License to the contrary, you cannot charge for, sell,
      license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive
      compensation for the Source Code.

   (( 5. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then
   you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
   possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from
   adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer
   programming to be able to understand it.

   (( 6. ))??
   Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor
   or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated
   herein by this reference.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of This License.

      (( a. ))??
      New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new
      versions of the License.

      (( b. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a
      particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version, provided that any such license be in full force
      and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or otherwise terminated.
      You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any
      subsequent version (but not any prior version) of the License published by
      Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.

      (( c. ))??
      Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version
      of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software
      that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename
      your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and
      must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this
      License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of
      Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
   AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE
   OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE
   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 9. ))??
   Termination.

      (( a. ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of being
      notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of this provision,
      proof of delivery via email to the address listed in the 'WHOIS' database
      of the registrar for any website through which you distribute or market
      any Licensed Product, or to any alternate email address which you
      designate in writing to the Licensor, shall constitute sufficient
      notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly
      granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they
      continue to complye with the terms of this License. Provisions that, by
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
      License, shall survive.

      (( b. ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as
      Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future
      use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent.
      If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
      are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
      claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under
      Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice
      Period.

      (( c. ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( d. ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by
      you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
      termination.

   (( 10. ))??
   Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
   WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE
   LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY
   SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
   EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
   OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 11. ))??
   Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party
   is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor
   and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
   Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
   liability.

   (( 12. ))??
   U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that
   term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial
   computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such
   terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
   12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
   Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set
   forth herein.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
   provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
   excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that in any
   litigation relating to this license the losing party shall be responsible for
   costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
   or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 14. ))??
   Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in
   upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
   under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
   version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you
   includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, is under common control
   with, or affiliated with, you. For purposes of this definition, control means
   (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
   such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity. You are responsible for advising any affiliated
   entity of the terms of this License, and that any rights or privileges
   derived from or obtained by way of this License are subject to the
   restrictions outlined herein.

   Conditions

   If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work,
   or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated,
   made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a
   "Recipient"), either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the
   Recipient, You must comply with the following conditions:

      (( 4.1. ))??
      Provide Access to Source Code

      Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
      Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
      Source Code corresponding to the Work ("Access").

      The "Source Code" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
      making modifications, including any comments, configuration information,
      documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic
      seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient

      (( 4.2. ))??
      Maintain User Autonomy

      In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to
      the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License
      to interfere with a Recipient's ability to fully use an independent copy
      of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the
      Recipient's own User Data.

      "User Data" means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work,
      where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical
      use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and
      where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right
      to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been
      assigned to the Recipient.

         (( 4.2.1. ))??
         No Withholding User Data

         Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
         granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
         Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
         provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient's User
         Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is available
         to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

         (( 4.2.2. ))??
         No Technical Measures that Limit Access

         You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
         anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
         cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
         protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient's
         ability to access any functionality present in Recipient's independent
         copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
         Recipient's User Data.

         (( 4.2.3. ))??
         No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

         You may not contractually restrict a Recipient's ability to
         independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
         waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
         measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the
         capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
         enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

      (( 4.3. ))??
      Provide Notices and Attribution

      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
      contained in the Source Code (the "Notices"), and provide all such Notices
      to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the
      Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an
      easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to
      Source Code.

      (( 4.4. ))??
      Scope of Conditions in this License

      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to
      those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing
      Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy
      of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires
      You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions
      with anyone.

      (( 4.5. ))??
      Combined Work Exception

      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source
      Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the "Combined
      Work Exception," or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code
      files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a "Larger Work."
      So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the
      applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by
      Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not
      limit Recipient's ability to independently work with their User Data, any
      other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole
      may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

   (( 5. ))??
   Term and Termination

   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues
   until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all
   Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever
   comes first ("Term"). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the
   reasons listed below.

      (( 5.1. ))??
      Effect of Termination

      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to
      You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will
      immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License
      relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

      (( 5.2. ))??
      Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of
      the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for
      non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will
      automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the
      conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by
      Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You
      are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only,
      and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of
      noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License
      due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or
      b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is
      permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in
      writing.

      (( 5.3. ))??
      Termination Due to Litigation

      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work,
      either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License
      shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all
      permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or
      indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures,
      declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent
      litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated
      under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.

   (( 6. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any
   kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages
   related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or
   for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the
   use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses.

   (( 7. ))??
   Other Provisions

      (( 7.1. ))??
      Affiliates

      An "Affiliate" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through
      one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common
      control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons
      acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also
      Affiliates.

      (( 7.2. ))??
      Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a
      Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the
      courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular
      jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor
      provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all
      Licensees.

      (( 7.3. ))??
      No Sublicensing

      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
      Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
      license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any
      further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients'
      exercise of the permissions granted herein.

      (( 7.4. ))??
      Attorneys' Fees

      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
      relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the
      prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
      including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
      incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
      action. A "prevailing party" is the party that achieves, or avoids,
      compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section
      shall survive the termination of this License.

      (( 7.5. ))??
      No Waiver

      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not
      constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
      Licensor's ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

      (( 7.6. ))??
      Severability

      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
      provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to
      the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is
      not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from
      this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and
      effect.

      (( 7.7. ))??

Version 1.1 ))??

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN
SOURCE LICENSE ("LICENSE"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe
that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs
to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our
continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined
below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to
use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the
concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying
Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain
open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software
programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your
Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this
License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you
may use the Program.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

      (( 1.1 ))??
      Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in
      the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the
      Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third
      parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to
      the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
      Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
      which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
      with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not
      derivative works of the Program.

      (( 1.2 ))??
      Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the
      Program.

      (( 1.3 ))??
      Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program
      that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made
      to the Program thereafter.

      code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
      time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
      Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such
      combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under
      this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the
      Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms
      hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of
      the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by
      each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the

      person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
      for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of
      intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising
      the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
      needed, if any.

      (( 2.4 ))??
      Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and
      interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to
      grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

   (( 3. ))??
   DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

      (( 3.1 ))??
      If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice

      source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object
      code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

         *
         it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and

         *
         its license agreement:

         *
         effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
         conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
         title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum

         *
         effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent
         permitted by applicable law;

         *
         states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         *
         states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to
         obtain it in a reasonable manner.

         *
         it must be made available under this License; and

         *
         a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the
      Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge
      Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.
      Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee,
      or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under
      this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for
      the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal
      to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work.
      It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from
      charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge
      to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the
      foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for
      the Program itself.

      (( 3.4 ))??
      A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other
      software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute
      the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must
      make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
      Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
      offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not
      any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including,
      but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement
      representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any
      additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
      includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
      (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
      Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the
      Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,
      damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and
      other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
      Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any
      additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in
      connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this
      section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
      alleged intellectual property infringement.

      (( 3.5 ))??
      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys
      intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by

      litigation is filed.

      aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License
      terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program
      as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under

      relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.

   (( 11. ))??
   GENERAL

      (( 11.1 ))??
      If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
      necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      (( 11.2 ))??
      CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from

      was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is
      published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
      Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right
      to modify this License.

      (( 11.3 ))??
      If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute,
      judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the
      terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
      limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
      the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all
      distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited
      by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
      for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

      (( 11.4 ))??

      Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year
      after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a
      jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute
      resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take
      place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the
      personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts
      within that district with respect to this License. The application of the
      United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a

Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__

exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You

license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions).

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to

SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work

to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested.

__1__

intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted

purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,

intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License

granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(b), as requested.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You.

__1__ //** Non-standard paragraph break. **//
This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

   __1__ Definitionen

      __1__ Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das
      Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange
      dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann
      insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung
      oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern
      sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme
      in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des
      Schutzgegenstandes.

      __1__ Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine
      Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder
      wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese
      Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen
      selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt,
      unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt
      und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.

      __1__ "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand
      oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von
      Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der
      Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.

      __1__ Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche
      oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den
      Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin
      auftritt.

      __1__ "Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person,
      die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die
      in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung,
      Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw
      Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt.

      __1__ Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den
      literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter
      den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine
      eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen
      Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes
      Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner
      Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung
      erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit
      Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen
      immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch
      sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.

      __1__ Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person
      gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des
      Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand
      nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die
      ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese
      Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes
      auszuüben.

      __1__ Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind
      Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu
      verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit
      bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag,
      Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit-
      und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den
      zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich
      drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.

      __1__ "Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in
      welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob
      vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des
      Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder
      Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der
      wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von
      Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer
      geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in
      digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium.

   __1__ Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte

   Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des
   Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich
   aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der
   Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden
   Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen
   Schutzes ergeben.

   __1__ Lizenzierung

   Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber -
   unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) -
   die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des
   Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand)
   unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art
   und Weise zu nutzen:

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu
      vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil
      solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten, einschließlich Übersetzungen
      unter Nutzung jedweder Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar
      gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt;

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen,
      öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten; und

      __1__ Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen,
      öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.

      __1__ Bezüglich der Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes
      gilt Folgendes:

         __1__ Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit
         unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche
         Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für
         Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das
         ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche
         für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu
         machen.

         __1__ Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb
         dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der
         Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des
         Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.

         __1__ Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter
         Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden
         vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber
         auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der
         Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine
         Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.

   Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch
   nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht,
   solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach
   dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle
   sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom
   Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit
   Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz
   oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener
   Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher
   daraus resultierender Rechte.

   __1__ Bedingungen

   Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz
   erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:

      __1__ Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den
      Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie
      müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige
      Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen.
      Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder
      fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz
      gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht
      unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie
      verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise
      unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss
      hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich
      wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine
      technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in
      der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern
      können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen
      Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das
      Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein
      Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die
      Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b)
      aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen,
      müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel ist – auf die Mitteilung eines
      Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten
      Hinweise entfernen.

      __1__ Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender
      Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie,
      vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu
      gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die
      Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung
      entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst –
      soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:

         __1__ Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird)
         Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den
         Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung
         an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder
         eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung
         dieses oder dieser Dritten;

         __1__ den Titel des Inhaltes;

         __1__ in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI,
         z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand
         angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den
         Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;

         __1__ und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes in
         Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich
         um eine Bearbeitung handelt.

      Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder
      angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das
      Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden
      dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die
      Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt
      dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben
      bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser
      Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich
      vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des
      Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine
      Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den
      Urheber, den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder
      erklären.

      __1__ Die oben unter 4.a) und b) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht
      für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den
      Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder
      Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz
      eigener Art genießen.

      __1__ (Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von
      dieser Lizenz unberührt.

   __1__ Gewährleistung

   SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM
   LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG

   ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG
   AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER

   VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN
   BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN.

   __1__ Haftungsbeschränkung

   ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER
   IHNEN GEGENÜBER FÜR SCHÄDEN JEGLICHER ART NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT
   ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG
   FÜR FOLGE- ODER ANDERE SCHÄDEN, AUCH WENN ER ÜBER DIE MÖGLICHKEIT IHRES
   EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE.

   __1__ Erlöschen

      __1__ Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung
      erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen
      die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des
      Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der
      Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die
      Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke
      sowie entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser
      Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene
      Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich
      ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten
      die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz
      fort.

      __1__ Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz
      unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft.
      Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand
      unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des
      Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses
      Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder
      irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits
      erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz
      unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen
      vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.

   __1__ Sonstige Bestimmungen

      __1__ Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als
      Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet
      der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und
      im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.

      __1__ Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes
      verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem
      Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen
      Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.

      __1__ Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon
      die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.

      __1__ Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß
      gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem
      Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.

      __1__ Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen
      Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich
      vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber
      und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine
      Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den
      Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind.
      Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem
      Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz
      möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie
      übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch
      schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert
      werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem
      Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß 8.a)
      und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus.

      __1__ Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige
      Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf
      diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the

official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License

Rights.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and

Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the

((License))??

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

__1__

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

__1__

rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted
hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common
law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT

EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work.  Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written
consent of Creative Commons.  Any permitted use will be in compliance with

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.

__1__ //** Non-standard paragraph break **//
You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
4(c), as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.__1__ For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more

and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for

exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections;

__1__ to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
a modification could indicate "The original work has been
modified.";

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(c), as requested.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(c).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms
and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   __1__ Definitions

      __1__ "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified
      form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate
      and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
      Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

      __1__ "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
      Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
      constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
      the purpose of this License.

      __1__ "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
      Work.

      __1__ "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
      terms of this License.

      __1__ "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
      respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
      Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
      violation.

   __1__ Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
   or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
   on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
   applicable laws.

   __1__ License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise
   the rights in the Work as stated below:

      __1__ to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collective Works;

      __1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
      known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
      such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
      other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
      hereby reserved.

   __1__ Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      __1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
      must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
      License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms
      of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
      the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
      create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
      Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

      __1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
      above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the
      Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
      otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
      no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
      copyrighted works.

      __1__ If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact
      all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
      (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
      of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
      manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a
      minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
      credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
      comparable authorship credit.

   __1__ Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

      __1__ By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
      represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
      reasonable inquiry:

         __1__ Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant
         the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
         rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any
         royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;

         __1__ The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity
         rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or
         constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to
         any third party.

      __1__ EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
      WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS"
      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR
      ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

   __1__ Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING
   FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
   LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Termination

      __1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under
      this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
      such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

      __1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
      is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
      under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
      time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
      this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
      granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   __1__ Miscellaneous

      __1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
      this License.

      __1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      __1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
      breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
      signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

      __1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
      Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
      in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without
      the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including

arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image

License.

that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this

Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted

specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.  Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
comparable authorship credit.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.

NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__

any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any

this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image

License.

applicable laws.

and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for

one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and

Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
authors of Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(b).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. THE LICENSOR IS NOT
NECESSARILY AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (IGO), AS DEFINED IN THE LICENSE
BELOW.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("LICENSE"). THE LICENSOR (DEFINED BELOW) HOLDS COPYRIGHT AND
OTHER RIGHTS IN THE WORK. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THE
LICENSE.

   __1__ Definitions

      __1__ "IGO" means, solely and exclusively for purposes of this License, an
      organization established by a treaty or other instrument governed by
      international law and possessing its own international legal personality.
      Other organizations established to carry out activities across national
      borders and that accordingly enjoy immunity from legal process are also
      IGOs for the sole and exclusive purposes of this License. IGOs may include
      as members, in addition to states, other entities.

      __1__ "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work eligible for
      copyright protection, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression
      including digital form, and offered under the terms of this License. It is
      understood that a database, which by reason of the selection and
      arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation, is
      considered a Work.

      __1__ "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License and may be, but is
      not necessarily, an IGO.

      __1__ "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License.

      __1__ "Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any manner or form,
      and by any means.

      __1__ "Distribute" means the activity of making publicly available the
      Work (or copies of the Work), as applicable, by sale, rental, public
      lending or any other known form of transfer of ownership or possession of
      the Work or copy of the Work.

      __1__ "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
      and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
      process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
      performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
      members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
      individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
      means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
      of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.

      __1__ "Adaptation" means a work derived from or based upon the Work, or
      upon the Work and other pre-existing works. Adaptations may include works
      such as translations, derivative works, or any alterations and
      arrangements of any kind involving the Work. For purposes of this License,
      where the Work is a musical work, performance, or phonogram, the
      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image is an
      Adaptation. For the avoidance of doubt, including the Work in a Collection
      is not an Adaptation.

      __1__ "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works or
      other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(b)
      which by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
      constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
      each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
      together are assembled into a collective whole. For the avoidance of
      doubt, a Collection will not be considered as an Adaptation.

   __1__ Scope of this License. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright protection.

   __1__ License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
   to exercise the rights in the Work as follows:

      __1__ to Reproduce, Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work, to
      incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce,
      Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections. This License lasts for the duration of the term of the
      copyright in the Work licensed by the Licensor. The above rights may be
      exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.
      The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are
      technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats,
      but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. All rights not
      expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
      limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

   __1__ Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      __1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
      of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
      recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
      under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work (see
      section 8(a). You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
      and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform
      the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
      Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
      itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent
      practicable, remove from the Collection any credit (inclusive of any logo,
      trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(c),
      as requested.

      __1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
      above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the
      Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
      otherwise shall not be considered to be primarily intended for or directed
      toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
      there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the
      exchange of copyrighted works.

      __1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Collections,
      You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
      intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
      medium or means You are utilizing: (i) any attributions that the Licensor
      indicates be associated with the Work as indicated in a copyright notice,
      (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated
      with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
      licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section
      4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
      credit for all contributors to the Collection appears, then as part of
      these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
      other contributors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
      credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
      manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
      You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Licensor or others designated for
      attribution, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
      prior written permission of the Licensor or such others.

      __1__ For the avoidance of doubt:

         __1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;

         __1__ Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights
         is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
         permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect
         royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

         __1__ Voluntary License Schemes. To the extent possible, the Licensor
         waives the right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the
         Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under
         any voluntary licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
         expressly reserves the right to collect such royalties.

      __1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if You
      Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take
      other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
      to the honor or reputation of the Licensor where moral rights apply.

   __1__ Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
   AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
   WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

   __1__ Limitation on Liability IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU
   ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
   EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
   THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Termination

      __1__ Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this License, the
      license granted here lasts for the duration of the term of the copyright
      in the Work licensed by the Licensor as stated in Section 3.
      Notwithstanding the above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the
      Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
      time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
      this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
      granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated below.

      __1__ If You fail to comply with this License, then this License and the
      rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by
      You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
      received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
      their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
      full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
      survive any termination of this License. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      this License reinstates automatically as of the date the violation is
      cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of You discovering the
      violation, or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the
      avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(b) does not affect any rights the
      Licensor may have to seek remedies for violations of this License by You.

   __1__ Miscellaneous

      __1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
      the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
      License.

      __1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable, it
      shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
      terms of this License, and without further action, such provision shall be
      reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
      enforceable.

      __1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
      breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
      signed by the Licensor.

      __1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the
      Licensor with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not
      specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
      provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
      not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
      You.

      __1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
      License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
      the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
      1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
      WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
      Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). Interpretation of the
      scope of the rights granted by the Licensor and the conditions imposed on
      You under this License, this License, and the rights and conditions set
      forth herein shall be made with reference to copyright as determined in
      accordance with general principles of international law, including the
      above mentioned conventions.

      __1__ Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
      limitation upon or waiver of any privileges and immunities that may apply
      to the Licensor or You, including immunity from the legal processes of any
      jurisdiction, national court or other authority.

      __1__ Where the Licensor is an IGO, any and all disputes arising under
      this License that cannot be settled amicably shall be resolved in
      accordance with the following procedure:

         __1__ Pursuant to a notice of mediation communicated by reasonable
         means by either You or the Licensor to the other, the dispute shall be
         submitted to non-binding mediation conducted in accordance with rules
         designated by the Licensor in the copyright notice published with the
         Work, or if none then in accordance with those communicated in the
         notice of mediation. The language used in the mediation proceedings
         shall be English unless otherwise agreed.

         __1__ If any such dispute has not been settled within 45 days following
         the date on which the notice of mediation is provided, either You or
         the Licensor may, pursuant to a notice of arbitration communicated by
         reasonable means to the other, elect to have the dispute referred to
         and finally determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be
         conducted in accordance with the rules designated by the Licensor in
         the copyright notice published with the Work, or if none then in
         accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as then in force. The
         arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator and the language
         of the proceedings shall be English unless otherwise agreed. The place
         of arbitration shall be where the Licensor has its headquarters. The
         arbitral proceedings shall be conducted remotely (e.g., via telephone
         conference or written submissions) whenever practicable.

         __1__ Interpretation of this License in any dispute submitted to
         mediation or arbitration shall be as set forth in Section 8(e), above.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License
("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such
rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not
Share Adapted Material;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License

possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and

or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

disclaimer of warranties.  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.  The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
the terms of this License.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

__1__
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__

Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work.  Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages

in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.

transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
4(d), as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any

exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights

Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to

This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or

attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(c).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS
OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
"LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A
CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__ "Collective Work" means a work, such
as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with one or more other contributions, constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

__1__ "Derivative Work" means a work based
upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing
works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be
recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

__1__ "Licensor" means the individual,
individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work
under the terms of this License.

__1__ "Original Author" means the
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
the Work.

__1__ "Work" means the copyrightable work
of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

__1__ "You" means an individual or entity
exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with
respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

__1__ "License Elements" means the
following high-level license attributes as selected by
Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work
as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__ to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided
that any such Derivative Work, including any translation
in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
the original Work. For example, a translation could be
marked "The original work was translated from English to
Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
work has been modified.";

__1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only
under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose
any technological measures on the Work that restrict the
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(d),
as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

__1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work
only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later
version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; or, (iii) either the unported Creative
Commons license or a Creative Commons license for another
jurisdiction (either this or a later license version)
that contains the same License Elements as this License
(e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
(Unported ) )  ("the Applicable License"). You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the
Applicable License with every copy or phonorecord of each
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works
that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. When You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Derivative Work, You may not impose any technological
measures on the Derivative Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as
defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as
defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of
the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of
the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with
Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work
or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part
of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket
Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect whether individually or, in the
event that Licensor is a member of a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that
society, royalties for the public performance or
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory
Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music
rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create
from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
or private monetary compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory
Royalties.__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or
the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE
EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE
LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY,
MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above)
or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from
You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a
Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
You under this License.

__1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use
to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following
considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do
not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract,
You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available
under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights

moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the

essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are
Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and

individually chosen by them.

from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well

different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights

construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.

the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible
License.

extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
supplied.  Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at
least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

__1__

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted
hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common
law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

__1__
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work.  Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written
consent of Creative Commons.  Any permitted use will be in compliance with

of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions).

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works.  All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
4(b), as requested.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
(i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case
of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions
as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary
or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
including in any form recognizably derived from the
original, except that a work that constitutes a
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a musical work, performance or
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License.

__1__ "Collection" means a collection of
literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
other contributions, each constituting separate and

assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an

and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You

granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
requested.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms
and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory

required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of
this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties.  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.  The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
the terms of this License.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable

AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__

law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work.  Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written
consent of Creative Commons.  Any permitted use will be in compliance with

License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies
to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later
version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US ) ) ; (iv) a Creative Commons
Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply
with the terms of that license. If you license the
Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
License"), you must comply with the terms of the
Applicable License generally and the following
provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI
for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
the terms of the Applicable License.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if

copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the
use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
translation of the Work by Original Author," or
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

DER GEGENSTAND DIESER LIZENZ (WIE UNTER „SCHUTZGEGENSTAND" DEFINIERT) WIRD
UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL", „LIZENZ"
ODER "LIZENZVERTRAG") ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH
DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES
SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE
GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG.

DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM
SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH
EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT
IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM
AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
AKZEPTIEREN.

   __1__ Definitionen

      __1__ Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das
      Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange
      dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann
      insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung
      oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern
      sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme
      in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des
      Schutzgegenstandes.

      __1__ Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine
      Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder
      wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese
      Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen
      selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt,
      unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt
      und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.

      __1__ "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand
      oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von
      Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der
      Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.

      __1__ Unter "Lizenzelementen" werden im Sinne dieser Lizenz die folgenden
      übergeordneten Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber
      ausgewählt wurden und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz zum Ausdruck kommen:
      "Namensnennung", "Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen".

      __1__ Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche
      oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den
      Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin
      auftritt.

      __1__ "Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person,
      die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die
      in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung,
      Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw
      Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt.

      __1__ Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den
      literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter
      den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine
      eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen
      Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes
      Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner
      Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung
      erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit
      Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen
      immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch
      sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.

      __1__ Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person
      gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des
      Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand
      nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die
      ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese
      Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes
      auszuüben.

      __1__ Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind
      Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu
      verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit
      bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag,
      Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit-
      und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den
      zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich
      drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.

      __1__ "Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in
      welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob
      vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des
      Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder
      Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der
      wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von
      Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer
      geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in
      digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium.

      __1__ "Mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz" bezeichnet eine Lizenz, die
      unter https:/creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses aufgelistet ist und
      die durch Creative Commons als grundsätzlich zur vorliegenden Lizenz
      äquivalent akzeptiert wurde, da zumindest folgende Voraussetzungen
      erfüllt sind:

      Diese mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz

         __1__ enthält Bestimmungen, welche die gleichen Ziele verfolgen, die
         gleiche Bedeutung haben und die gleichen Wirkungen erzeugen wie die
         Lizenzelemente der vorliegenden Lizenz; und

         __1__ erlaubt ausdrücklich das Lizenzieren von ihr unterstellten
         Abwandlungen unter vorliegender Lizenz, unter einer anderen
         rechtsordnungsspezifisch angepassten Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit
         denselben Lizenzelementen wie vorliegende Lizenz aufweist oder unter
         der entsprechenden Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz.

   __1__ Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte

   Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des
   Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich
   aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der
   Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden
   Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen
   Schutzes ergeben.

   __1__ Lizenzierung

   Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber -
   unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) -
   die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des
   Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand)
   unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art
   und Weise zu nutzen:

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu
      vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil
      solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten, einschließlich Übersetzungen
      unter Nutzung jedweder Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar
      gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt;

      __1__ Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen,
      öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten; und

      __1__ Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen,
      öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.

      __1__ Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt
      Folgendes:

         __1__ Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit
         unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche
         Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für
         Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das
         ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche
         für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu
         machen.

         __1__ Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Soweit Zwangslizenzen außerhalb
         dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der
         Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des
         Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.

         __1__ Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter
         Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden
         vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber
         auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der
         Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine
         Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.

   Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch
   nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht,
   solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach
   dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle
   sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom
   Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit
   Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz
   oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener
   Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher
   daraus resultierender Rechte.

   __1__ Bedingungen

   Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz
   erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:

      __1__ Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den
      Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie
      müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige
      Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen.
      Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder
      fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz
      gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht
      unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie
      verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise
      unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss
      hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich
      wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine
      technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in
      der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern
      können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen
      Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das
      Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein
      Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die
      Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c)
      aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen,
      müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel ist – auf die Mitteilung eines
      Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten
      Hinweise entfernen.

      __1__ Sie dürfen eine Bearbeitung ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen

         __1__ dieser Lizenz,

         __1__ einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben
         Lizenzelementen,

         __1__ einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit
         denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung
         - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US),

         __1__ der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben
         Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder

         __1__ einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz

      verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben.

      Falls Sie die Bearbeitung gemäß Abschnitt b)(v) unter einer mit Creative
      Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren
      Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten.

      Falls Sie die Bearbeitung unter einer der unter b)(i)-(iv) genannten
      Lizenzen ("Verwendbare Lizenzen") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren
      Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen
      stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige
      Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen,
      wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie
      dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern,
      die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten
      Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Bearbeitung, die Sie verbreiten oder
      öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare
      Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die
      Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug
      auf die Bearbeitung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den
      Nutzer der Bearbeitung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare
      Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt
      auch für den Fall, dass die Bearbeitung einen Bestandteil eines
      Sammelwerkes bildet; dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass das Sammelwerk
      insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss.

      __1__ Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender
      Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie,
      vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu
      gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die
      Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung
      entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst –
      soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:

         __1__ Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird)
         des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in
         den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine
         Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein
         Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen
         bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;

         __1__ den Titel des Inhaltes;

         __1__ in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI,
         z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand
         angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den
         Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;

         __1__ und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes in
         Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich
         um eine Bearbeitung handelt.

      Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder
      angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des
      Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das
      Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden
      dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die
      Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt
      dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben
      bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser
      Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich
      vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des
      Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine
      Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den
      Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären.

      __1__ Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht
      für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den
      Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder
      Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz
      eigener Art genießen.

      __1__ (Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von
      dieser Lizenz unberührt.

   __1__ Gewährleistung

   LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG

   VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN
   BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN.

   EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE.

   __1__ Erlöschen

      __1__ Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung
      erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen
      die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des
      Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der
      Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die
      Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke
      sowie entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser
      Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene
      Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich
      ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten
      die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz
      fort.

      __1__ Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz
      unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft.
      Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand
      unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des
      Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses
      Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder
      irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits
      erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz
      unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen
      vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.

   __1__ Sonstige Bestimmungen

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To
the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted
the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits
the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these
terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are
Attribution and ShareAlike.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor
to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of
the Adapter’s License You apply.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.

__1__ The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

__1__ You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based
on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

__1__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted
Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's
License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of his
knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of the
country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever
copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship identified below (the
"Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright
interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes, is
described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this
work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from
liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and
future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the Work.
Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the
relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and
in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.

DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY
FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER. ))??

((Statement of Purpose))??

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

   __1__ Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

      __1__ the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;

      __1__ moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
      performer(s);

      __1__ publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;

      __1__ rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph __2__, below;

      __1__ rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
      data in a Work;

      __1__ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

      __1__ other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

   __1__ Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably
   and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's
   Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
   whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and
   causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
   the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
   Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
   Statement of Purpose.

   __1__ Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
   and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
   in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
   (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
   for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
   advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
   deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
   Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
   ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
   shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
   hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
   remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
   associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
   case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   __1__ Limitations and Disclaimers.

      __1__ No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
      abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

      __1__ Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent
      permissible under applicable law.

      __1__ Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
      persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,
      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
      permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

      __1__ Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to

      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
      license steward.

      (( 4.3. ))??

      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer

      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.

   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING

   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 8. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as

   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
   License.

   (( 9. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

      Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
      rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
      You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter
      any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
      Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
      attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Application of Additional Terms.

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
      Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
      or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
      terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
      which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
      in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
      in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
      distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
      license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
      or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
      every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
      such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

   (( 4. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 4.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
      versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
      other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

      (( 4.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
      license steward.

      (( 4.3. ))??
      Modified Versions.

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the
      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains
      terms which differ from this License.

   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 6. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer
      or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
      "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
      where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
      the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
      value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or
      2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
      payment or license.

      (( 6.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
      hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
      distributor) shall survive termination.

   (( 7. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 8. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as

   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
   Software.

   (( 10. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

PREAMBULE

Ce contrat est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer
aux utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de redistribution du logiciel
régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un modèle de diffusion «open
source».

L'exercice de ces libertés est assorti de certains devoirs à la charge des
utilisateurs afin de préserver ce statut au cours des redistributions
ultérieures.

L'accessibilité au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n'offrir aux
utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur l'auteur du
logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs
qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques associés
au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au développement et
à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité
de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve
donc à des développeurs et des professionnels avertis possédant des
connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à
charger et tester l'adéquation du Logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et ou de leurs données
et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les même conditions
de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous
réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des
droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il
contient.

between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main principles
guiding its drafting:

   -
   firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and
   intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to authors and
   the holders of economic rights over software.

   -
   secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free
   software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C : CNRS,
I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

   Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and
   industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33 rue
   de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

   PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the
   right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within
   the framework of an "open source" distribution model.

   The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for
   users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent
   redistribution operations.

   As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
   and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
   limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
   rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
   associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
   the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean
   that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it
   is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth
   computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
   Software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling
   the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally,
   to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may
   be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no
   Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

   This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
   economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

(( CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ))??

(( Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main
principles guiding its drafting:

   *
   firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free
   Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,

   *
   secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is
   conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law,
   and the protection that it offers to both authors and holders of the economic
   rights over software.

The authors of the
//** CeCILL¹ **//
__5__
license are:

   Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and
   industrial research establishment, having its principal place of business at
   25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

   Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and
   technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue
   Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

   Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA, a
   public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place
   of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay
   cedex, France. ))??

   (( Preamble ))??
   The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the
   right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within
   the framework of an open source distribution model.

   The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for
   users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

   In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify
   and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
   limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
   rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
   developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's
   attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to
   use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced
   professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
   encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their
   requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data
   to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same
   conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
   published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either
   added or removed herefrom.

   This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
   economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

      compensation from the Licensor.

   (( Article 9 - ))??
   WARRANTY

      (( 9.1 ))??
      The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
      state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
      possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of possible
      defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's attention has been
      drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
      developing and reproducing the Software which are reserved for experienced
      users.

      The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the
      suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order,
      and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or
      properties.

      (( 9.2 ))??
      The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to
      grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights
      set forth in Article 5).

      (( 9.3 ))??
      The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by the
      Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than that
      provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty as to
      its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature.

      Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from
      any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will be
      compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software configuration,
      nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

      (( 9.4 ))??
      The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
      Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
      relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the
      Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out
      of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in
      respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software.
      Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee,
      the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
      defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a
      case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant
      to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all
      liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
      warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name
      of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

   (( Article 10 - ))??
   TERMINATION

      (( 10.1 ))??
      In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the
      Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after
      notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.

      (( 10.2 ))??
      A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to
      use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may
      have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid
      subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and
      conditions hereof.

   (( Article 11 - ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS

      (( 11.1 ))??
      EXCUSABLE EVENTS

      Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform
      the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an
      act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or
      interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network
      paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government
      authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire,
      explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

      (( 11.2 ))??
      Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke one or
      more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted
      as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to invoke said
      provision(s) subsequently.

      (( 11.3 ))??
      The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether
      written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and
      constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning
      said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions
      hereof shall be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in
      writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

      (( 11.4 ))??
      In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict
      with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or
      legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make the necessary
      amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative text. All other
      provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity of a provision of
      the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as
      a whole to be invalid.

      The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions are
      deemed authentic.

Version 2.1 dated 2013-06-21
(( Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main
principles guiding its drafting:

   *
   firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free
   Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,

   (( Preamble ))??
   The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the
   right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within
   the framework of an open source distribution model.

   The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
   users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

   In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify
   and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
   limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
   rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
   developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's
   attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to
   use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced
   professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
   encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their
   requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data
   to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same
   conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
   published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either
   added or removed herefrom.

   This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
   economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

      (( 8.2 ))??
      The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under this
      Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular: (i) loss
      due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its obligations,
      (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the Licensee due to

      compensation from the Licensor.

   (( Article 9 - ))??
   WARRANTY

      (( 9.1 ))??
      The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
      state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
      possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of possible
      defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's attention has been
      drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
      developing and reproducing the Software which are reserved for experienced
      users.

      The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the
      suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order,
      and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or
      properties.

      (( 9.2 ))??
      The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to
      grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights
      set forth in Article 5
      (( <#scope> ))??
      ).

      (( 9.3 ))??
      The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by the
      Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than that
      provided for in Article 9.2
      (( <#good-faith> ))??
      and, in particular, without any warranty as to its commercial value, its
      secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature.

      Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from
      any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will be
      compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software configuration,
      nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

      (( 9.4 ))??
      The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
      Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
      relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the
      Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out
      of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in
      respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software.
      Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee,
      the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal expertise for its
      defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be decided on a
      case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant
      to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all
      liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
      warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name
      of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

   (( Article 10 - ))??
   TERMINATION

      (( 10.1 ))??
      In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the
      Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after
      notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.

      (( 10.2 ))??
      A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to
      use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may
      have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid
      subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and
      conditions hereof.

   (( Article 11 - ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS

      (( 11.1 ))??
      EXCUSABLE EVENTS

      Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform
      the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an

      provision(s) subsequently.

      (( 11.3 ))??
      The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether
      written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and

   (( Preamble ))??
   This Agreement is an open source software license intended to give users
   significant freedom to modify and redistribute the software licensed
   hereunder.

   The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon a strong obligation of
   giving credits for everybody that distributes a software incorporating a
   software ruled by the current license so as all contributions to be properly
   identified and acknowledged.

   In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify
   and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
   limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
   rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
   developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's

   (( Article 9 - ))??
   WARRANTY

      (( 9.1 ))??

      drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
      developing and reproducing the Software which are reserved for experienced
      users.

      The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the
      suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order,
      and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or
      properties.

      The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to
      grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights
      set forth in Article 5).

      (( 9.3 ))??
      The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by the
      Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than that
      provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty as to
      its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature.

      Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from
      any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will be
      compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software configuration,
      nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

      The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
      Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
      relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the
      Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out
      of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in
      respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software.
      Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee,
      the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
      defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a
      case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant
      to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all
      liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
      warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name
      of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

   (( Article 10 - ))??
   TERMINATION

      (( 10.1 ))??
      In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the
      Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after
      notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.

      (( 10.2 ))??
      A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to
      use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may
      have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid
      subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and
      conditions hereof.

   (( Article 11 - ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS

      (( 11.1 ))??
      EXCUSABLE EVENTS

      Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform

      provision(s) subsequently.

      (( 11.3 ))??
      The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether
      written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and
      constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning
      said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions
      hereof shall be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in
      writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

      (( 11.4 ))??
      In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict
      with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or

(( CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ))??

(( Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main
principles guiding its drafting:

   *
   firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free
   Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,

   *
   secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is
   conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law,
   and the protection that it offers to both authors and holders of the economic
   rights over software.

The authors of the

   cedex, France. ))??

   (( Preamble ))??
   The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the
   right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.

   The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make
   available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the
   software so as to contribute to its evolution.

   In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify
   and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
   limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
   rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
   developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's
   attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to
   use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced
   professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
   encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their
   requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data
   to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same
   conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
   published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either
   added or removed herefrom.

   This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
   economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

      The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
      Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
      relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the
      Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out
      of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in
      respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software.
      Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee,
      the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
      defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a
      case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant
      to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all
      liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
      warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name
      of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

      (( 10.2 ))??
      A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to
      use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may
      have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid
      subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and
      conditions hereof.

(( CERN OHL v1.2

2013-09-06 - CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2 ))??

Preamble

Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence ("CERN OHL") version 1.2, CERN wishes to
provide a tool to foster collaboration and sharing among hardware designers. The
CERN OHL is copyright CERN. Anyone is welcome to use the CERN OHL, in unmodified
form only, for the distribution of their own Open Hardware designs. Any other
right is reserved. Release of hardware designs under the CERN OHL does not
constitute an endorsement of the licensor or its designs nor does it imply any
involvement by CERN in the development of such designs.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meanings:

"Licence" means this CERN OHL.

"Documentation" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board
layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other
explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the
conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be in any medium, including
but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any
other media.

"Documentation Location" means a location where the Licensor has placed
Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly accessible for at least
three years from the first communication to the public or distribution of
Documentation.

"Product" means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the
Documentation or the modified Documentation.

"Licensee" means any natural or legal person exercising rights under this
Licence.

"Licensor" means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies
Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or distributes
the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence.

A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa.

Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders and is
employed solely to facilitate reading.

2. Applicability

   (( 2.1. ))??
   This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, communication to the
   public and distribution of the Documentation, and the manufacture and
   distribution of Products. By exercising any right granted under this Licence,
   the Licensee irrevocably accepts these terms and conditions.

   (( 2.2. ))??
   This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to the Licensee, and shall
   apply worldwide and without limitation in time. The Licensee may assign his
   licence rights or grant sub-licences.

   (( 2.3. ))??
   This Licence does not extend to software, firmware, or code loaded into
   programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with the Documentation,
   the modified Documentation or with Products, unless such software, firmware,
   or code is explicitly expressed to be subject to this Licence. The use of
   such software, firmware, or code is otherwise subject to the applicable
   licence terms and conditions.

3. Copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution of the
Documentation

   (( 3.1. ))??
   The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright and trademarks notices, all
   notices referring to Documentation Location, and all notices that refer to
   this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the
   Documentation. He shall include a copy thereof in every copy of the
   Documentation or, as the case may be, modified Documentation, that he
   communicates to the public or distributes.

   (( 3.2. ))??
   The Licensee may copy, communicate to the public and distribute verbatim
   copies of the Documentation, in any medium, subject to the requirements
   specified in section 3.1.

   (( 3.3. ))??
   The Licensee may modify the Documentation or any portion thereof provided
   that upon modification of the Documentation, the Licensee shall make the
   modified Documentation available from a Documentation Location such that it
   can be easily located by an original Licensor once the Licensee communicates
   to the public or distributes the modified Documentation under section 3.4,
   and, where required by section 4.1, by a recipient of a Product. However, the
   Licensor shall not assert his rights under the foregoing proviso unless or
   until a Product is distributed.

   (( 3.4. ))??
   The Licensee may communicate to the public and distribute the modified
   Documentation (thereby in addition to being a Licensee also becoming a
   Licensor), always provided that he shall:

      (( a) ))??
      comply with section 3.1;

      cause the modified Documentation to carry a new Documentation Location
      notice if the original Documentation provided for one;

      (( d) ))??
      make available the modified Documentation at the same level of abstraction
      as that of the Documentation, in the preferred format for making
      modifications to it (e.g. the native format of the CAD tool as
      applicable), and in the event that format is proprietary, in a format
      viewable with a tool licensed under an OSI-approved license if the
      proprietary tool can create it; and

      license the modified Documentation under the terms and conditions of this
      Licence or, where applicable, a later version of this Licence as may be
      issued by CERN.

   (( 3.5. ))??
   The Licence includes a non-exclusive licence to those patents or registered
   designs that are held by, under the control of, or sub-licensable by the
   Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted under
   this Licence. The scope of this section 3.5 shall be strictly limited to the
   parts of the Documentation or modified Documentation created by the
   Licensor.

4. Manufacture and distribution of Products

   (( 4.1. ))??
   The Licensee may manufacture or distribute Products always provided that,
   where such manufacture or distribution requires a licence under this Licence
   the Licensee provides to each recipient of such Products an easy means of
   accessing a copy of the Documentation or modified Documentation, as
   applicable, as set out in section 3.

   (( 4.2. ))??
   The Licensee is invited to inform any Licensor who has indicated his wish to
   receive this information about the type, quantity and dates of production of
   Products the Licensee has (had) manufactured

5. Warranty and liability

   or use are disclaimed in respect of the Documentation, the modified
   Documentation or any Product. The Licensor makes no representation that the
   Documentation, modified Documentation, or any Product, does or will not
   infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The
   entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of a Product shall be
   with the Licensee and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an
   essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights
   granted under this Licence. The Licensee warrants that it does not act in a
   consumer capacity.

   (( 5.2. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY – The Licensor shall have no liability for direct,
   indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other
   damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of

   interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort
   (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in
   relation to the Documentation, modified Documentation and/or the use,
   manufacture or distribution of a Product, even if advised of the possibility
   of such damages, and the Licensee shall hold the Licensor(s) free and
   harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including
   claims by third parties, in relation to such use.

   (( 6.1. ))??
   Except for the rights explicitly granted hereunder, this Licence does not
   imply or represent any transfer or assignment of intellectual property rights
   to the Licensee.

   (( 6.2. ))??
   The Licensee shall not use or make reference to any of the names (including
   acronyms and abbreviations), images, or logos under which the Licensor is

   kind of endorsement by the Licensor or its personnel of the modified
   Documentation or any Product, or any kind of implication by the Licensor or
   its personnel in the preparation of the modified Documentation or Product.

   (( 6.3. ))??
   CERN may publish updated versions of this Licence which retain the same
   general provisions as this version, but differ in detail so far this is
   required and reasonable. New versions will be published with a unique version
   number.

   (( 6.4. ))??
   This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect, upon written notice and
   without involvement of a court if the Licensee fails to comply with any of

      CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it
      considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with a
      unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant. If
      the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered
      Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as
      being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no
      variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being
      released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that the Covered
      Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later
      version in which case You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL
      with the same variant identifier published by CERN.

      (( 7.4 ))??
      This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such,
      and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.

         (( a) ))??
         retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;

         (( b) ))??
         add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You have
         modified it, with the date and brief description of how You have
         modified it;

         (( c) ))??
         add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source if You
         Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not otherwise receive
         a copy of the modified Covered Source; and

         (( d) ))??
         license the modified Covered Source under the terms and conditions of
         this Licence (or, as set out in subsection 8.3, a later version, if
         permitted by the licence of the original Covered Source). Such modified
         Covered Source must be licensed as a whole, but excluding Available
         Components contained in it, which remain licensed under their own
         applicable licences.

   (( 4 ))??
   Making and Conveying Products

   You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either provide
   each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure that each
   recipient is notified of the Source Location of the Complete Source. That
   Complete Source is Covered Source, and You must accordingly satisfy Your
   obligations set out in subsection 3.3. If specified in a Notice, the Product
   must visibly and securely display the Source Location on it or its packaging
   or documentation in the manner specified in that Notice.

   (( 5 ))??
   Research and Development

   You may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to a legal
   entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance work on Your
   behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which prevent the entity
   from both using the Source or Products for its own internal purposes and
   Conveying the Source or Products or any modifications to them to any person
   other than You. Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be
   made by You pursuant to subsection 3.2.

   (( 6 ))??
   DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

      (( 6.1 ))??
      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are provided
      'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited
      to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality,
      non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular
      purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the
      maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no representation that
      any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any patent, copyright,
      trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use,
      quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and
      not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this
      Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this
      Licence.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the
      maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect,
      special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages
      of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute
      goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption,
      however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including
      negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in
      relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making
      or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such
      damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any
      liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third
      parties, in relation to such use.

   (( 7 ))??
   Patents

      (( 7.1 ))??
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor hereby
      grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4)
      patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
      otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence
      applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are
      necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as
      Conveyed by that Licensor.

      (( 7.2 ))??
      If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source
      or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or
      You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this Licence
      is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this
      Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated.

   (( 8 ))??
   General

      (( 8.1 ))??
      If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or
      unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain
      effective.

      (( 8.2 ))??
      You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations),
      image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known, except where needed
      to comply with section 3, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law.
      Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to
      suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement by the
      Licensor or its personnel.

      (( 8.3 ))??
      CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it
      considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with a
      unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant. If
      the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered
      Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as
      being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no
      variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being
      released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that the Covered
      Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later
      version in which case You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL
      with the same variant identifier published by CERN.

      (( 8.4 ))??
      This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply
      with any of its terms and conditions.

      (( 8.5 ))??
      However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your Licence from
      any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this
      Licence by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying the
      breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have failed to
      come into compliance in all material respects by the end of the 30 day
      period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and
      subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate immediately and
      permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any termination.

      (( 8.6 ))??
      This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such,
      and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.

(( CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal ))??

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study,
modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those
designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants:
CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: this licence, CERN- OHL-W
(weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-W is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or
their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.

   (( 1 ))??
   Definitions

      (( 1.1 ))??
      'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-W.

      (( 1.2 ))??

         any version of the CERN-OHL-S or the CERN-OHL-W, or

         (( c) ))??
         any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it applies
         as licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W provided that on Conveyance
         of any such Source, or any associated Product You treat the Source in
         question as being licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W as
         appropriate.

      (( 1.3 ))??
      'Source' means information such as design materials or digital code which
      can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product for use,
      Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is expressed. It
      may include Notices.

      (( 1.4 ))??
      'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available under this
      Licence.

      (( 1.5 ))??
      'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether in
      finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or
      processing of Covered Source.

      (( 1.6 ))??
      'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture,
      assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another Product
      or otherwise.

         is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing it is
         first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective licensees

            (( i) ))??
            with sufficient rights and information (including any configuration
            and programming files and information about its characteristics and
            interfaces) to enable it either to be Made itself, or to be sourced
            and used to Make the Product; or

            (( ii) ))??
            as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to design or Make
            the Product.

      (( 1.8 ))??
      'External Material' means anything (including Source) which:

         (( a) ))??
         is only combined with Covered Source in such a way that it interfaces
         with the Covered Source using a documented interface which is described
         in the Covered Source; and

         (( b) ))??
         is not a derivative of or contains Covered Source, or, if it is, it is
         solely to the extent necessary to facilitate such interfacing.

      in the preferred form for making modifications, including necessary
      installation and interfacing information both for the Product, and for any
      included Available Components. If the format is proprietary, it must also
      be made available in a format (if the proprietary tool can create it)
      which is viewable with a tool available to potential licensees and
      licensed under a licence approved by the Free Software Foundation or the
      Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need not include the Source of any
      Available Component, provided that You include in the Complete Source

   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1 ))??
      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4 ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
         Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
         which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
         also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5 ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6 ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
      agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7 ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1 ))??
      New Versions.

      Socialtext, Inc. ("Socialtext") may publish revised and/or new versions of
      the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one
      other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3 ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Socialtext", "CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
      License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the
      Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
      notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??

   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1 ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2 ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original
      Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or
      Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
      "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3 ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4 ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
   ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
   CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each
   party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
   with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute
   such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits
   you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or
   the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the
   file described in Exhibit A.

   (( 14. ))??
   ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION

      (( (a) ))??
      As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the
      Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional
      value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the
      Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B
      ("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable and
      Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes
      initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer's
      Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user
      interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may
      include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image
      should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the
      Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable
      and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the
      Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code
      displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the
      form of a splash screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated
      attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form
      for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement
      for notice.

      (( (b) ))??
      Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief
      phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject
      to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent
      shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to
      the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include
      Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must
      ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall
      be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar
      information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original
      Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above
      attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code
      resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger
      Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,
      therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any
      time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a)
      a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a
      word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image
      provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the
      "Attribution Limits").

      (( c ))??
      If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are
      no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the
      Original Developer.

      (( (d) ))??
      You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names
      contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered
      Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with
      the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted
      by law or as expressly set out in this License.

   (( 15. ))??
   ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.

   The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication
   of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code
   or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works
   are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an
   application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the
   grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of
   the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and
   make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
(( 1. ))??

DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

   (( a) ))??
   in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
   distributed under this Agreement, and

   (( b) ))??
   in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

      (( i) ))??
      changes to the Program, and

      (( ii) ))??
      additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.
(( 2. ))??

GRANT OF RIGHTS

   (( a) ))??
   Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
   such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

   (( b) ))??
   Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
   Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
   transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
   object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
   Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
   Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
   covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
   licensed hereunder.

   (( c) ))??
   Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
   its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
   intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
   any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
   infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
   needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
   allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
   to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

   (( d) ))??
   Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
   rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth
   in this Agreement.
   (( 3. ))??

REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

   (( a) ))??
   it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

   (( b) ))??
   its license agreement:

      (( i) ))??
      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
      conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
      title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
      merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

      (( ii) ))??
      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
      damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
      damages, such as lost profits;

      (( iii) ))??
      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
      that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

      (( iv) ))??
      states that source code for the Program is available from such
      Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
      on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

   (( a) ))??
   it must be made available under this Agreement; and

   (( b) ))??
   a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
   the Program.

   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
   if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
   the originator of the Contribution.
   (( 4. ))??

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.
(( 5. ))??

NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
(( 6. ))??

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
(( 7. ))??

GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
         Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
         which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
         also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. CUA Office Project may publish revised and/or new versions
      of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CUA
      Office Project. No one other than CUA Office Project has the right to
      modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
      (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license
      so that the phrases "CUA Office", "CUA", "CUAPL", or any confusingly
      similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your
      license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
      Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CUA
      Office Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
      Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
      not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically

         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
   permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
   NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer

(( The Clarified Artistic License ))??

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified
below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to
another party.

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the item,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from the Copyright
   Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
   Standard Version.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network archive
      site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright
      Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
      Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      (( e) ))??
      permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
      permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific
      way.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
      get the Standard Version.

      (( b) ))??
      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the
      differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on
      where to get the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      (( e) ))??
      offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications,
      by mail order.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. If
   you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose for
   that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use this
   Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with other
   (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a larger
   (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge
   license fees for other parts of that software distribution, provided that you
   do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package
   includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's interpreter within an
   executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of
   aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter
   is so embedded.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or
   library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or
   "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of
   such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package
   nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that
   you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
   Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
   supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines
   and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered
   part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6,
   provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would
   cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

   (( 8. ))??
   Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
   distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
   embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
   interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
   shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

   (( 9. ))??
   The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
   products derived from this software without specific prior written
   permission.

   (( 10. ))??
   THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Präambel

Software ist mehr als ein Wirtschaftsgut. Sie ist die technische Grundlage der
Informationsgesellschaft. Die Frage der Teilhabe der Allgemeinheit ist deswegen
von besonderer Bedeutung. Herkömmlich lizenzierte Programme werden nur im
Object Code vertrieben, der Nutzer darf das Programm weder verändern noch
weitergeben. Das Lizenzmodell der Freien Software (synonym "Open Source
Software") gewährt Ihnen dagegen umfassende Freiheiten im Umgang mit dem
Programm. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz folgt diesem Lizenzmodell. Sie
gewährt Ihnen das Recht, das Programm in umfassender Weise zu nutzen. Es ist
Ihnen gestattet, das Programm nach Ihren Vorstellungen zu verändern, in
veränderter oder unveränderter Form zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und
öffentlich zugänglich zu machen. Diese Rechte werden unentgeltlich
eingeräumt.

Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz verbindet die Rechtseinräumung allerdings
mit Pflichten, die dem Zweck dienen, das freie Zirkulieren des Programms und
aller veröffentlichten Fortentwicklungen zu sichern. Wenn Sie das Programm
verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie jedem, der das
Programm von Ihnen erhält, eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitliefern und den Zugriff
auf den Source Code ermöglichen. Eine weitere Pflicht betrifft
Fortentwicklungen des Programms. Änderungen am Programm, die Sie öffentlich
verbreiten oder zugänglich machen, müssen nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz
frei gegeben werden.

Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz nimmt auf die besonderen Anforderungen des
deutschen und europäischen Rechts Rücksicht. Sie ist zweisprachig gestaltet
und damit auch auf den internationalen Vertrieb ausgerichtet. ))??

   § 2 Pflichten beim Vertrieb

      (( (1) ))??
      Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, sei
      es in unveränderter oder veränderter Form, sei es in einer Kombination
      mit anderen Programmen oder in Verbindung mit Hardware, dann müssen sie
      mitliefern:

      (( 1. ))??
      alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die auf diese Lizenz
      hinweisen;

      (( 2. ))??
      alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die über die Urheber
      des Programms Auskunft geben;

      (( 3. ))??
      einen für den Empfänger deutlich wahrnehmbaren Hinweis auf diese Lizenz
      und die Internetadressehttp:/www.d-fsl.de;

      (( 4. ))??
      den vollständigen Text dieser Lizenz in deutlich wahrnehmbarer Weise.

      (( (2) ))??
      Wenn bei der Installation des Programms und/oder beim Programmstart
      Lizenz- und/oder Vertragsbedingungen angezeigt werden, dann müssen

      (( 1. ))??
      diese Lizenz,

      (( 2. ))??
      ein Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und

      (( 3. ))??
      ein Hinweis auf den oder die Rechtsinhaber an den ersten unter dieser
      Lizenz nutzbaren Programmbestandteilen

      ebenfalls angezeigt werden.

      (( (3) ))??
      Sie dürfen die Nutzung des Programms nicht von Pflichten oder Bedingungen
      abhängig machen, die nicht in dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind.

      (( (4) ))??
      Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese
      Dokumentation entsprechend mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie
      Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die
      Dokumentation nicht gestattet.

   § 3 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb veränderter Versionen

      (( (1) ))??
      Veränderte Versionen des Programms dürfen Sie nur unter den Bedingungen
      dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, so dass
      Dritte das veränderte Programm insgesamt unter dieser Lizenz nutzen
      können.

      (( (2) ))??
      Wird das Programm oder ein Teil hiervon mit einem anderen Programm
      kombiniert, gilt auch die Kombination insgesamt als eine veränderte
      Version des Programms, es sei denn, das andere Programm ist formal und
      inhaltlich eigenständig. Ein anderes Programm ist dann als eigenständig
      anzusehen, wenn es die folgenden Voraussetzungen alle erfüllt:

         (( 1. ))??
         Der Source Code der kombinierten Programme muss jeweils in eigenen
         Dateien vorhanden sein, die keine Bestandteile des anderen Teils
         enthalten, die über die zur Programmkombination üblichen und
         erforderlichen Informationen über den anderen Teil hinausgehen, wobei
         der Source Code des anderen Programms nicht mitgeliefert werden muss.

         (( 2. ))??
         Der mit dem Programm kombinierte Teil muss auch dann sinnvoll nutzbar
         sein, wenn er nicht mit dem Programm kombiniert wird, und zwar entweder
         alleine oder mit sonstigen Programmen. Was als "sinnvoll nutzbar"
         anzusehen ist, richtet sich nach der Auffassung der betroffenen
         Fachkreise. Zu den betroffenen Fachkreisen gehören alle Personen, die
         das Programm oder Programme mit vergleichbarer Funktionalität
         entwickeln, benutzen, verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen.

      (( (3) ))??
      Wenn Sie das Programm oder einen Teil hiervon - verändert oder
      unverändert - zusammen mit einem anderen Programm verbreiten oder
      öffentlich zugänglich machen, das unter der GNU General Public License
      (GPL) lizenziert wird, darf das Programm auch unter den Bedingungen der
      GPL genutzt werden, sofern es mit dem anderen Programm ein "derivative
      work" im Sinne der GPL bildet. Dabei sollen die Hinweise auf diese Lizenz
      entfernt und durch einen Hinweis auf die GPL ersetzt werden. Ob bei der
      Zusammenstellung ein "derivate work" im Sinne der GPL entsteht, beurteilt
      sich nach Ziffer 2 b) der GPL. Diese Bestimmung lautet: "You must cause
      any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
      or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
      whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License."
      Die GPL kann abgerufen werden unter http:/www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.

      (( (4) ))??
      Wenn Sie das Programm in einer veränderten Form verbreiten oder
      öffentlich zugänglich machen, müssen Sie im Source Code einen Hinweis
      mit den Änderungen aufnehmen und mit dem Datum der Änderung versehen.
      Der Hinweis muss erkennen lassen, welche Änderungen vorgenommen wurden
      und bestehende Vermerke, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft
      geben, übernehmen. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob Sie einen eigenen
      Urhebervermerk hinzufügen. Anstelle eines Hinweises im Source Code
      können Sie auch ein Versionskontrollsystem verwenden oder weiterführen,
      sofern dieses mitverbreitet wird oder öffentlich zugänglich ist.

      (( (5) ))??
      Sie dürfen von Dritten für die Einräumung eines einfachen
      Nutzungsrechts an veränderten Versionen des Programms kein Entgelt
      verlangen.

      (( (6) ))??
      Wenn Sie an der veränderten Version des Programms ein anderes Schutzrecht
      als ein Urheberrecht erwerben, insbesondere ein Patent oder
      Gebrauchsmuster, lizenzieren Sie dieses Schutzrecht für veränderte und
      unveränderte Versionen des Programms in dem Umfang, der erforderlich ist,
      um die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz wahrnehmen zu können.

   § 4 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb im Object Code

      (( (1) ))??
      Wenn Sie das Programm nur im Object Code verbreiten, dann müssen Sie
      zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten entweder

         (( 1. ))??
         den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich
         machen und bei der Verbreitung des Object Codes deutlich auf die
         vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen, unter der der Source Code
         abgerufen werden kann oder

         (( 2. ))??
         den vollständigen Source Code auf einem hierfür üblichen
         Datenträger unter Beachtung der §§ 2 und 3 mitverbreiten.

      (( (2) ))??
      Wenn Sie das Programm im Object Code öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann
      müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten den
      vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und
      dabei deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen.

      (( (3) ))??
      Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese
      Dokumentation entsprechend der Absätze 1 und 2 mitgeliefert werden, es
      sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der
      Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet.

   § 5 Vertragsschluss

      (( (1) ))??
      Mit dieser Lizenz wird Ihnen und jeder anderen Person ein Angebot auf
      Abschluss eines Vertrages über die Nutzung des Programms unter den
      Bedingungen der Deutschen Freien Softwarelizenz unterbreitet.

      (( (2) ))??
      Sie dürfen das Programm nach den jeweils anwendbaren gesetzlichen
      Vorschriften bestimmungsgemäß benutzen, ohne dass es der Annahme dieser
      Lizenz bedarf. Dieses Recht umfasst in der Europäischen Union und in den
      meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen insbesondere die folgenden Befugnisse:

         (( 1. ))??
         das Programm ablaufen zu lassen sowie die Erstellung von hierfür
         erforderlichen Vervielfältigungen im Haupt- und Arbeitsspeicher;

         (( 2. ))??
         das Erstellen einer Sicherungskopie;

         (( 3. ))??
         die Fehlerberichtigung;

         (( 4. ))??
         die Weitergabe einer rechtmäßig erworbenen körperlichen Kopie des
         Programms.

      (( (3) ))??
      Sie erklären Ihre Zustimmung zum Abschluss dieser Lizenz, indem Sie das
      Programm verbreiten, öffentlich zugänglich machen, verändern oder in
      einer Weise vervielfältigen, die über die bestimmungsgemäße Nutzung im
      Sinne von Absatz 2 hinausgeht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist diese Lizenz als
      rechtlich verbindlicher Vertrag zwischen den Rechtsinhabern und Ihnen
      geschlossen, ohne dass es eines Zugangs der Annahmeerklärung bei den
      Rechtsinhabern bedarf.

      (( (4) ))??
      Sie und jeder andere Lizenznehmer erhalten die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz
      direkt von den Rechtsinhabern. Eine Unterlizenzierung oder Übertragung
      der Rechte ist nicht gestattet.

   § 6 Beendigung der Rechte bei Zuwiderhandlung

      (( (1) ))??
      Jede Verletzung Ihrer Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz führt zu einer
      automatischen Beendigung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz.

      (( (2) ))??
      Die Rechte Dritter, die das Programm oder Rechte an dem Programm von Ihnen
      erhalten haben, bleiben hiervon unberührt.

   § 7 Haftung und Gewährleistung

      (( (1) ))??
      Für entgegenstehende Rechte Dritter haften die Rechtsinhaber nur, sofern
      sie Kenntnis von diesen Rechten hatten, ohne Sie zu informieren.

      (( (2) ))??
      Die Haftung für Fehler und sonstige Mängel des Programms richtet sich
      nach den außerhalb dieser Lizenz getroffenen Vereinbarungen zwischen
      Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern oder, wenn eine solche Vereinbarung nicht
      existiert, nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen.

   § 8 Verträge mit Dritten

      (( (1) ))??
      Diese Lizenz regelt nur die Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und den
      Rechtsinhabern. Sie ist nicht Bestandteil der Verträge zwischen Ihnen und
      Dritten.

      (( (2) ))??
      Die Lizenz beschränkt Sie nicht in der Freiheit, mit Dritten, die von
      Ihnen Kopien des Programms erhalten oder Leistungen in Anspruch nehmen,
      die im Zusammenhang mit dem Programm stehen, Verträge beliebigen Inhalts
      zu schließen, sofern Sie dabei Ihren Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz
      nachkommen und die Rechte der Dritten aus dieser Lizenz nicht
      beeinträchtigt werden. Insbesondere dürfen Sie für die Überlassung des
      Programms oder sonstige Leistungen ein Entgelt verlangen.

      (( (3) ))??
      Diese Lizenz verpflichtet Sie nicht, das Programm an Dritte weiterzugeben.
      Es steht Ihnen frei zu entscheiden, wem Sie das Programm zugänglich
      machen. Sie dürfen aber die weitere Nutzung durch Dritte nicht durch den
      Einsatz technischer Schutzmaßnahmen, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von
      Kopierschutzvorrichtungen jeglicher Art, verhindern oder erschweren. Eine
      passwortgeschützte Zugangsbeschränkung oder die Nutzung in einem
      Intranet wird nicht als technische Schutzmaßnahme angesehen.

   § 9 Text der Lizenz

      (( (1) ))??
      Diese Lizenz ist in deutscher und englischer Sprache abgefasst. Beide
      Fassungen sind gleich verbindlich. Es wird unterstellt, dass die in der
      Lizenz verwandten Begriffe in beiden Fassungen dieselbe Bedeutung haben.
      Ergeben sich dennoch Unterschiede, so ist die Bedeutung maßgeblich,
      welche die Fassungen unter Berücksichtigung des Ziels und Zwecks der
      Lizenz am besten miteinander in Einklang bringt.

      (( (2) ))??
      Der Lizenzrat der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz kann mit verbindlicher
      Wirkung neue Versionen der Lizenz in Kraft setzen, soweit dies
      erforderlich und zumutbar ist. Neue Versionen der Lizenz werden auf der
      Internetseite http:/www.d-fsl.de mit einer eindeutigen Versionsnummer
      veröffentlicht. Die neue Version der Lizenz erlangt für Sie verbindliche
      Wirkung, wenn Sie von deren Veröffentlichung Kenntnis genommen haben.
      Gesetzliche Rechtsbehelfe gegen die Änderung der Lizenz werden durch die
      vorstehenden Bestimmungen nicht beschränkt.

      (( (3) ))??
      Sie dürfen diese Lizenz in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen,
      verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen.

   § 10 Anwendbares Recht

   Auf diese Lizenz findet deutsches Recht Anwendung.

   Anhang: Wie unterstellen Sie ein Programm der Deutschen Freien Software
   Lizenz?

   Um jedermann den Abschluss dieser Lizenz zu ermöglichen, wird empfohlen, das

You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using
DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software
code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC

freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that
you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us

DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part

daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005,"
which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States
that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and

   grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
   irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
   such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   (( 3. ))??
   Grant of Patent License.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
   grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
   irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
   made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
   Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or
   by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to
   contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is
   limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work
   is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the
   organization or institution has the right to grant such license under
   applicable grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied
   licenses are granted.

   (( 4. ))??
   Redistribution.

   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
   thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
   form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (( a. ))??
      You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
      of this License; and

      (( b. ))??
      You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
      You changed the files; and

      (( c. ))??
      You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
      the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
      to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (( d. ))??
      If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
      then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
      of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
      at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
      distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
      display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
      third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
      for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add
      Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
      alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
      the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
      provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
      reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
      distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
      this License.

   (( 5. ))??
   Submission of Contributions.

   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
   submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
   terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
   conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
   modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
   Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   (( 6. ))??
   Trademarks.

   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
   service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
   reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
   reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty.

   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
   the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
   TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
   using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
   exercise of permissions under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   Limitation of Liability.

   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such
   as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
   Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
   special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
   (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
   computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
   damages.

   (( 9. ))??
   Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

((THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM))??
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
((THE PROGRAM || THIS SOFTWARE))
CONSTITUTES
((THE))??
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a) ))??
      in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
      distributed under this Agreement, and

      (( b) ))??
      in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

         (( i) ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii) ))??
         additions to the Program;

         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
         are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
         Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
         Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
         separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
         Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
         works of the Program.

   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

   "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
   necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
   combined with the Program.

   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.

   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
   including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a) ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b) ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
      by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c) ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d) ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
   its own license agreement, provided that:

      (( a) ))??
      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      (( b) ))??
      its license agreement:

         (( i) ))??
         effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
         conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
         title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         (( ii) ))??
         effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         (( iii) ))??
         states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
         by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         (( iv) ))??
         states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      (( a) ))??
      it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      (( b) ))??
      a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
      within the Program.

   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
   if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
   the originator of the Contribution.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
   (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
   infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
   under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
   order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
   modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
   publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
   Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
   Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
   Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
   be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
   Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
   Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
   the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
   (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
   stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
   licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
   Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
   rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
   reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of __2__ and the
   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
   in any resulting litigation.

      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or
      other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
      the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
      to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply
      to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
      se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c) ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d) ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

      (( e) ))??
      Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes
      additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this
      Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under
      the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section
      3).

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

      (( 3.1 ))??
      If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

         (( a) ))??
         the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
         with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
         statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
         Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;
         and

         (( b) ))??
         the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different
         than this Agreement, provided that such license:

            (( i) ))??
            effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
            or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose;

            (( ii) ))??
            effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
            liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
            incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

            (( iii) ))??
            does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the
            Source Code under section 3.2; and

            (( iv) ))??
            requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to
            be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section
            3.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

         (( a) ))??
         it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)
         is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
         available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
         attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
         Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of
         such Secondary Licenses, and

         (( b) ))??
         a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
      attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
      ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program
      which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own
      appropriate notices.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
   BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
   Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
   this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
   errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
   or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
   BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
   LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER
   CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
   OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
   OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
   (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
   infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
   under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
   order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
   modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
   publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
   Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
   Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
   Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
   be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
   Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the
   Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
   the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program
   (including its Contributions) under the new version.

   Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
   receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
   Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
   or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
   Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be
   enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No
   third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

   Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

   "This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
   Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
   Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
   exceptions or additional permissions here}."

   Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
   sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

   If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
   then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
   relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
   notice.

   You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence.
Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited
(to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor
(as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the EUPL V.1.0

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. ))??

   (( 1. ))??
   Definitions

   In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

      The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or
      communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code
      and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

      −
      Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
      Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
      Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
      Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
      this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
      mentioned in Article 15.

      −
      The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

      −
      The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
      convenient for people to study and modify.

      −
      The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which
      is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

      The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or
      communicates the Work under the Licence.

      available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work at the disposal of any
      other natural or legal person.

   (( 2. ))??
   Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

   The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,

   vested in the Original Work:

      −
      use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,

      −
      reproduce the Work,

      −
      modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,

      −

      distribute the Work or copies thereof,

      −
      lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,

      −
      sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

   Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
   known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

   In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
   exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
   effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

   The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights
   to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
   the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

   (( 3. ))??
   Communication of the Source Code

   The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
   Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
   provides in addition a machinereadable copy of the Source Code of the Work
   along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
   in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
   where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
   Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

   (( 4. ))??
   Limitations on copyright

   Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
   from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
   in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of
   other applicable limitations thereto.

   (( 5. ))??
   Obligations of the Licensee

   The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
   obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

   Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
   trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
   disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices
   and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes
   and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
   prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of
   modification.

   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of
   the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
   Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
   Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any
   additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or
   restrict the terms of the Licence.

   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
   Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
   another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
   Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the
   sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence" refers to the licences listed in
   the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations
   under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
   Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of
   the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
   Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely
   available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or
   communicate the Work.

   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

   (( 6. ))??
   Chain of Authorship

   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
   granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
   has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
   brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
   he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each time You, as a Licensee, receive the Work, the original Licensor and
   subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the
   Work, under the terms of this Licence.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
   contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
   "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is"
   basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
   without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
   of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
   rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
   condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Liability

   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
   natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
   indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence
   or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
   commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility
   of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
   liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

   (( 9. ))??
   Additional agreements

   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
   conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
   of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
   services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
   Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
   Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
   against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
   additional liability.

   (( 10. ))??
   Acceptance of the Licence

   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I
   agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
   Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with
   the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
   irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
   conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
   Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative
   Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies
   thereof.

   (( 11. ))??
   Information to the public

   In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of
   electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the
   Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example,
   a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by
   the applicable law regarding the identification and address of the Licensor,
   the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and
   reproduced by the Licensee.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination of the Licence

   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

   Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
   received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
   remain in full compliance with the Licence.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
   agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
   law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
   whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
   make it valid and enforceable.

   The European Commission may put into force translations and/or binding new
   versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New
   versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. The
   new version of the Licence becomes binding for You as soon as You become
   aware of its publication.

   (( 14. ))??
   Jurisdiction

   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
   between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be
   subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European
   Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the
   European Community.

   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission,
   and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or
   conducts its primary business.

   (( 15. ))??
   Applicable Law

   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where
   the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

   This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

      −
      a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and
      any Licensee;

      −
      the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
      registered office inside a European Union country.

   the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

   (( 3. ))??
   Communication of the Source Code

   The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
   Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
   provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
   along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,

   Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits

   (( 5. ))??
   Obligations of the Licensee

   The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
   obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

   Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
   trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
   disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices
   and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes
   and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
   prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of
   modification.

   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of
   the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
   Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
   Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is
   expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee
   (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
   on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
   Licence.

   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
   Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
   another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
   Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the
   sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence," refers to the licences listed in
   the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations
   under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
   Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of
   the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
   Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely
   available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or
   communicate the Work.

   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

   (( 6. ))??
   Chain of Authorship

   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
   granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
   has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
   brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
   he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
   Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under
   the terms of this Licence.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
   contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
   "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is"
   basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
   without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
   of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
   rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
   condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Liability

   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
   natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
   indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence
   or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
   commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility
   of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
   liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

   (( 9. ))??
   Additional agreements

   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
   conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
   of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
   services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
   Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
   Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
   against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
   additional liability.

   (( 10. ))??
   Acceptance of the Licence

   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I
   agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
   Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with

   Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies
   thereof.

   (( 11. ))??

   Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example,
   a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by
   the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
   accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination of the Licence

   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a
   termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received
   the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in
   full compliance with the Licence.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
   agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
   law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
   whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
   make it valid and enforceable.

   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new
   versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without
   reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the
   Licence will be published with a unique version number.

   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
   have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
   their choice.

   between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be

         Modifications or combinations.

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
      only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of this
      License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
      on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
         intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
         utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the
         source code distribution titled ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
         the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
         know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
         interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
         to implement that API, you must also include this information in the
         LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If
      You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to
      put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
      that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
      license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply
   with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
   included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with
   all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
   statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE

   This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public License,
   Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License,
   Version 1.0.

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
   days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
   which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 9. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer or any
   Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor indirect).

   (( 10. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
   reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License
   shall be construed by and in accordance with the substantive laws of Sweden.
   Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this License,
   or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of Swedish courts, with the Stockholm City Court as
   the first instance.

Introduction

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them
may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and
contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall
under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font
engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group)
licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial
and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

   (( o ))??
   We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in
   any kind of bug reports. (` + "`" + `as is' distribution)

   (( o ))??
   You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form,
   without having to pay us. (` + "`" + `royalty-free' usage)

   (( o ))??
   You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only
   parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your
   documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (` + "`" + `credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or
without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties
covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType
Project.

Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to
use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following
text:

""" Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project
(www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. """

Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. ))??

Legal Terms

   (( 0. ))??
   Definitions

   Throughout this license, the terms ` + "`" + `package', ` + "`" + `FreeType Project', and
   ` + "`" + `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the
   authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the ` + "`" + `FreeType
   Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

   ` + "`" + `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where ` + "`" + `using' is a
   generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking
   it to form a ` + "`" + `program' or ` + "`" + `executable'. This program is referred to as ` + "`" + `a
   program using the FreeType engine'.

   This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType
   Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless
   otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed
   in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file
   is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

   The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert
   Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.

   (( 1. ))??
   No Warranty

   THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED ` + "`" + `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF
   THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE
   OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

   (( 2. ))??
   Redistribution

   This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable
   right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create
   derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both
   source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
   and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein,
   subject to the following conditions:

      (( o ))??
      Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (` + "`" + `FTL.TXT')
      unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must
      be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices
      of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source
      files.

      (( o ))??
      Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that
      the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the
      distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the
      FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

   These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType
   Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must
   acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.

   (( 3. ))??
   Advertising

   Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of
   the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without
   specific prior written permission.

   We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following
   phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising
   materials: ` + "`" + `FreeType Project', ` + "`" + `FreeType Engine', ` + "`" + `FreeType library', or
   ` + "`" + `FreeType Distribution'.

   As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.
   However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license,
   or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use,
   distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying
   the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the
   terms of this license.

   (( 4. ))??
   Contacts

   There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

      (( o ))??

   rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the intent and purpose of this
   Section 4 above, provided, however, that your rights and obligations
   hereunder shall be unaffected by any such sublicensing. In addition, The
   Frameworx Company expressly retains all rights to take all appropriate action
   (including legal action) against any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to
   ensure its full compliance with the intent and purposes of this License
   Agreement.

   (( 5. ))??
   Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this License
   Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx Companys respective
   intellectual property rights, including, in the case of The Frameworx
   Company, its copyrights and patent rights relating to the Frameworx Code
   Base.

      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms

      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such

      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims.

         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
         right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under
         this License), you must include a text file with the source code
         distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs.

         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You
         own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that
         API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
      describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one
      or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
      notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
      a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You descr
      ibe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
      the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,
      which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
      in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
   Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4
   and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
      from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
      number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg

      No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "FreeImage", ` + "`" + `FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
      otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms
      which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of
      the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter

   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions (except
   to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
   conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one

   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
   3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies
   of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing

   PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
   everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
   License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
   work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
   others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
   the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
   GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
   software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
   But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
   textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
   printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
   is instruction or reference.

   __1__ APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
   royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
   conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
   work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
   accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
   requiring permission under copyright law.

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
   or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
   Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
   authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
   matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
   subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
   Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
   a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
   or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
   regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
   the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
   Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
   does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
   Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
   Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
   words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
   generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
   programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
   suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
   variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
   otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
   been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
   not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
   "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
   publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
   PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
   include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
   be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
   the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
   for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
   following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
   requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
   any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
   appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
   text.

   The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the
   Document to the public.

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
   either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
   translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
   name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
   "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
   you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
   according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
   that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
   considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
   disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
   may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

   __1__ VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
   in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
   this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
   reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
   may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
   enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
   publicly display copies.

   __1__ COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
   covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
   notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
   carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
   front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
   clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
   cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
   Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
   title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
   verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
   should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
   cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
   with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
   access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
   latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
   copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
   year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
   your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
   a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   __1__ MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:

      __1__ Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
      from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
      should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
      original publisher of that version gives permission.

      __1__ List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
      responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
      of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
      you from this requirement.

      __1__ State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
      Version, as the publisher.

      __1__ Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      __1__ Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
      to the other copyright notices.

      __1__ Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
      giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
      of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      __1__ Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
      and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H.
      Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      __1__ Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
      to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
      of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
      Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
      authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
      add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
      sentence.

      __1__ Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
      public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
      network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based
      on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
      location for a work that was published at least four years before the
      Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
      gives permission.

      __1__ For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
      Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
      dedications given therein.

      __1__ Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
      their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.

      __1__ Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
      be included in the Modified Version.

      __1__ Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
      to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

      __1__ Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
   qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
   other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
   but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
   statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
   organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
   one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
   one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
   previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
   acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
   one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
   one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
   permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
   endorsement of any Modified Version.

   __1__ COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
   all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
   all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
   identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
   multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
   the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
   parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
   known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
   titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
   various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
   combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
   "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

   __1__ COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
   individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
   into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
   regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   __1__ AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
   the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
   users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
   in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
   aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
   aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
   the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
   the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
   covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   __1__ TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
   the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
   the original English version of this License and the original versions of
   those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
   translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
   disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
   or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
   will typically require changing the actual title.

   __1__ TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
   sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a
   copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use
   it.

   __1__ FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns. See http:/www.gnu.org/
((copyleft||licenses))
/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
   later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
   been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
   any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
   If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
   this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
   version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

   __1__ RELICENSING

   "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide
   Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent
   facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can
   edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration"
   (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus
   published on the MMC site.

   "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
   published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with
   a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future
   copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

   "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part,
   as part of another Document.

   An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License,
   and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other
   than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the
   MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus
   incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under
   CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC
   is eligible for relicensing.
((  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
   documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:

Copyright (c) __10__. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of
the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace
the "with...Texts." line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of
the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

   PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
   everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
   License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
   work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
   others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
   the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
   GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
   software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
   But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
   textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
   printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
   is instruction or reference.

   __1__ APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
   royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
   conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
   work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
   accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
   requiring permission under copyright law.

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
   or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
   Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
   authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
   matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
   subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
   Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
   a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
   or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
   regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
   the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
   Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
   does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
   Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
   Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
   words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
   generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
   programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
   suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
   variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
   otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
   been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
   not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
   "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
   publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
   PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
   include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
   be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
   the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
   for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
   following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
   requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
   any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
   appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
   text.

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
   either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
   translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
   name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
   "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
   you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
   according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
   that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
   considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
   disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
   may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

   __1__ VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
   in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
   this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
   reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
   may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
   enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
   publicly display copies.

   __1__ COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
   covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
   notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
   carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
   front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
   clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
   cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
   Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
   title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
   verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
   should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
   cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
   with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
   access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
   latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
   copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
   year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
   your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
   a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   __1__ MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:

      __1__ Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
      from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
      should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
      original publisher of that version gives permission.

      __1__ List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
      responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
      of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
      you from this requirement.

      __1__ State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
      Version, as the publisher.

      __1__ Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      __1__ Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
      to the other copyright notices.

      __1__ Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
      giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
      of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      __1__ Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
      and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

      __1__ Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      __1__ Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
      to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
      of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
      Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
      authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
      add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
      sentence.

      __1__ Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
      public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
      network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based
      on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
      location for a work that was published at least four years before the
      Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
      gives permission.

      __1__ For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
      Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
      dedications given therein.

      __1__ Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
      their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.

      __1__ Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
      be included in the Modified Version.

      __1__ Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
      to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

      __1__ Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
   qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
   other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
   but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
   statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
   organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
   one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
   one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
   previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
   acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
   one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
   one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
   permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
   endorsement of any Modified Version.

   __1__ COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
   all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
   all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
   identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
   multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
   the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
   parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
   known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
   titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
   various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
   combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
   "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

   __1__ COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
   individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
   into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
   regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   __1__ AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
   the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
   users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
   in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
   aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
   aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
   the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
   the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
   covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   __1__ TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
   the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
   the original English version of this License and the original versions of
   those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
   translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
   disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
   or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
   will typically require changing the actual title.

   __1__ TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
   expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
   sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns. See http:/www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
   later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
   been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
   any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
   Foundation.

(( ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:

Copyright (c) __10__. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of
the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace
the "with...Texts." line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of
the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

   is instruction or reference.

   __1__ APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
   of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
   Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
   or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
   Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
   authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
   matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
   subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
   a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
   be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
   matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
   position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
   Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
   Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
   automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
   formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup
   has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
   is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
   publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for
   human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary
   formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
   or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
   and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
   following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
   requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
   any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
   appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
   text.

   __1__ VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
   in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
   this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
   reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
   may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
   enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
   publicly display copies.

   __1__ COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
   the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
   copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
   Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
   Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of
   these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of
   the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
   covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as
   they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
   treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
   should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
   cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
   with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general
   network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using
   public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
   take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies
   in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible
   at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you
   distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
   that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
   a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   __1__ MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:

      __1__ Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
      from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
      should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
      original publisher of that version gives permission.

      __1__ List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
      responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
      of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

      __1__ State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
      Version, as the publisher.

      __1__ Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      __1__ Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
      to the other copyright notices.

      __1__ Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
      giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
      of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      __1__ Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
      and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

      __1__ Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      __1__ Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
      it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
      the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
      entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
      authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
      add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
      sentence.

      __1__ Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
      public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
      network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based
      on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
      location for a work that was published at least four years before the
      Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
      gives permission.

      __1__ In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
      preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
      dedications given therein.

      __1__ Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
      their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.

      __1__ Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
      be included in the Modified Version.

      __1__ Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
      in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
   qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
   other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
   but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
   statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
   organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
   one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
   one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
   previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
   acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
   one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
   one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
   permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
   endorsement of any Modified Version.

   __1__ COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
   all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
   identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
   multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
   the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
   parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
   known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
   titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
   various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
   combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
   "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

   __1__ COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
   individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
   into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
   regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   __1__ AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the
   Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.
   Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply
   to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account
   of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of
   the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
   aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
   only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
   around the whole aggregate.

   __1__ TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include
   the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this License, the
   original English version will prevail.

   __1__ TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
   expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
   sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns. See http:/www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
   later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
   been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
   any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
   Foundation.

((  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:

Copyright (c) __10__.

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is
included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead of
saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write "no
Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy
of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the
Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them
their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
MODIFICATION



   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
   to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
   the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
   verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you".



   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with
   the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
   copy.



   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1
   above, provided that you also do the following:

      __1__ cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change; and

      __1__ cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or
      without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties
      under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose
      to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your
      option).

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement
      including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
      warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
      redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
      to view a copy of this General Public License.

      __1__ You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
      fee.

   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
   derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   the other work under the scope of these terms.



   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2
      above; or,

      __1__ accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of
      distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
      code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

      __1__ accompany it with the information you received as to where the
      corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed
      only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
      in object code or executable form alone.)

   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it
   need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that
   accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for
   standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating
   system.



   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
   Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
   Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the
   Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
   rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.



   __1__ By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on
   the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all
   its terms and conditions.



   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein.



   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.



   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

__30__
//**
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
**//

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave,
Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'. This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for
details.

The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU
((Lesser||Library))
General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

__5__ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
   terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

__30__
//**
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
**//

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'. This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for

parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the
GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems
will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   __1__ Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   __1__ Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used
   among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   __1__ Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
   provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
      and giving a relevant date.

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
      notices".

      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
   other parts of the aggregate.

   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
      network server at no charge.

      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You
      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or
      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.

      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall
   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to
   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed
   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
   the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   __1__ Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or

      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
   terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
   apply either way.

   __1__ Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants
   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
   to do so.

   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
   with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   __1__ Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
   extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means
   you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying
   the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in
   a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country
   that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
   all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a
   royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
   only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   __1__ Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
   the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
   part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
   Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a
   network will apply to the combination as such.

   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
   version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
   GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
   the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   __1__ Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   __1__ Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
   all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
   assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
   fee.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

__30__

this program. If not, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be
different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead

(( Allegro 4 (the giftware license) ))??

Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in
cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify,
redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not
have to give us anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a
return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing an add-on
package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, or
perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it,
it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are
not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.

**//

(( 3DFX GLIDE Source Code General Public License ))??

   (( 1. ))??
   PREAMBLE

   This license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application program
   interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar to some
   standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open standards and
   unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these licenses require
   that, as a condition of the license of the software, any derivative works
   (that is, new software which is a work containing the original program or a
   portion of it) must be available for general use, without restriction other
   than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative
   works must likewise be made available. The only restriction is that such
   derivative works must be subject to the same General Public License terms as
   the original work.

   This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the standard
   licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire derivative work
   to be made available under the terms of this license nor is the recipient
   required to make available the source code for the entire derivative work.
   Rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the
   derivative work that is derived from the licensed software. The precise terms
   and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

   (( 2. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

      (( 2.1 ))??
      This License applies to any program (or other "work") which contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
      the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.

      (( 2.2 ))??
      The term "Program" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX's GLIDE source
      code and object code and any Derivative Work.

      (( 2.3 ))??
      "Derivative Work" means, for the purpose of the License, that portion of
      any work that contains the Program or the identifiable portion of a work
      that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or with modifications
      and/or translated into another language, and that performs 3D graphics API
      operations. It does not include any other portions of a work.

      (( 2.4 ))??
      "Modifications of the Program" means any work, which includes a Derivative
      Work, and includes the whole of such work.

      (( 2.5 ))??
      "License" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.

      (( 2.6 ))??
      The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
      means all the source code for all modules it contains, any associated
      interface definition files, and the scripts used to control compilation
      and installation of the executable work.

      (( 2.7 ))??
      "3dfx" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc.

   (( 3. ))??
   LICENSED ACTIVITIES

      (( 3.1 ))??
      COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
      Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the provision of
      section 3.3 and provided also that:

         (( (a) ))??
         you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
         copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice that
         recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can only
         do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as set
         forth in section 5;

         (( (b) ))??
         keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
         absence of any warranty; and

         (( c ))??
         do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior written
         permission of 3dfx, and

         (( (d) ))??
         give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
         the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this
         License.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your copy or
      copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such
      modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3 and provided that
      you also meet all of the following conditions:

         (( (a) ))??
         you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy of a
         Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that
         recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work
         can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as
         set forth in section 5;

         (( (b) ))??
         keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
         absence of any warranty; and (c) give all recipients of the Derivative
         Work a copy of this License along with the Derivative Work or
         instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this License.

         (( (d) ))??
         You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work to carry
         prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
         any change.

         (( (e) ))??
         You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or publish to be
         licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
         License.

         (( (f) ))??
         You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior
         written permission of 3dfx.

         (( (g) ))??
         If the Derivative Work normally reads commands interactively when run,
         you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use, to
         print or display an announcement as follows:

         "COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS
         SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
         EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE
         TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC.
         SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE
         DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM
         INFO@3DFX.COM)."

         (( (h) ))??
         The requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the modified work
         as a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not the intent of
         this License to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
         entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control
         the distribution of Derivative Works.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      DISTRIBUTION

         (( (a) ))??
         All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are distributed
         must include in the file headers the following language verbatim:

         "THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED ONLY
         PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO
         USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX
         INTERACTIVE, INC. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE
         DISTRIBUTOR OR BY CONTACTING 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC (info@3dfx.com). THIS
         PROGRAM. IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
         EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A
         FULL TEXT OF THE NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS.

         USE, DUPLICATION OR DISCLOSURE BY THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBJECT TO
         RESTRICTIONS AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION (C)(1)(II) OF THE RIGHTS IN
         TECHNICAL DATA AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE CLAUSE AT DFARS 252.227-7013,

         SUPPLEMENT. UNPUBLISHED RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF THE
         UNITED STATES.

         COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"

         (( (b) ))??
         You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in object code or
         executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided that
         you also do one of the following:

            (( (1) ))??
            Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and
            3.2; or,

            (( (2) ))??
            Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
            to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
            physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,

            (( (3) ))??
            Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
            distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
            only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
            program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
            accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.)

         (( c ))??
         The source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
         distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
         (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
         executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
         executable code.

         (( (d) ))??
         If distribution of executable code or object code is made by offering
         access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
         to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
         the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
         the source along with the object code.

         (( (e) ))??
         Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative Work, the
         recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and successor
         licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and Derivative
         Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License. You may not
         impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
         rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
         by third parties to this License.

         (( (f) ))??
         You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior
         written permission of 3dfx.

         (( (g) ))??
         You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program or any
         Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any
         attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
         or any Derivative Works is void, and will automatically terminate your
         rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
         or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
         terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   (( 4. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS

      (( 4.1 ))??
      Acceptance of this License is voluntary. By using, modifying or
      distributing the Program or any Derivative Work, you indicate your
      acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
      copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or
      Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this License is in
      violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws.

      (( 4.2 ))??
      If the distribution and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works is
      restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
      interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
      this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
      excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
      among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
      the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

      (( 4.3 ))??
      This License is to be construed according to the laws of the State of
      California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the State of
      California in the event it is necessary to enforce the provisions of this
      License.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTIES

      (( 5.1 ))??
      TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
      PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
      PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
      ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
      AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM OR ANY DERIVATIVE
      WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      (( 5.2 ))??
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC.,
      OR ANY OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
      REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
      TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
      PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
      DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
      OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
      PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(( Hippocratic License Version Number: 2.1. ))??

Purpose. The purpose of this License is for the Licensor named above to permit
the Licensee (as defined below) broad permission, if consistent with Human
Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles (as each is defined below), to use and
work with the Software (as defined below) within the full scope of Licensor's
copyright and patent rights, if any, in the Software, while ensuring attribution
and protecting the Licensor from liability.

Permission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this license
("License"), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor's rights under applicable
copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the "Licensee") obtaining a
copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to do
everything with the Software that would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor's
copyright in the Software or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the
Licensor can license or becomes able to license, subject to all of the following
terms and conditions:

   *
   Acceptance. This License is automatically offered to every person and entity
   subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this License and agrees
   to its terms and conditions by taking any action with the Software that,
   absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
   Licensor.

   *
   Notice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of
   this Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also receives the
   License and the above copyright notice (and if included by the Licensor,
   patent, trademark and attribution notice). Licensee must cause any modified
   versions of the Software to carry prominent notices stating that Licensee
   changed the Software. For clarity, although Licensee is free to create
   modifications of the Software and distribute only the modified portion
   created by Licensee with additional or different terms, the portion of the
   Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to this License. If anyone
   notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has not complied with this Notice
   section, Licensee can keep this License by taking all practical steps to
   comply within 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do so,
   Licensee's License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end
   immediately.

   *
   Compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws.

      (( 1. ))??
      Human Rights Principles.

         (( (a) ))??
         Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations
         Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global
         Compact that define recognized principles of international human rights
         (the "Human Rights Principles"). Licensee shall use the Software in a
         manner consistent with Human Rights Principles.

         (( (b) ))??
         Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute,
         controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a)
         regarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section
         1(a), termination of this License for breach of the Human Rights
         Principles, or invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of
         whether any Law is consistent or in conflict with Human Rights
         Principles pursuant to Section 2, below, shall be settled by
         arbitration in accordance with the Hague Rules on Business and Human
         Rights Arbitration (the "Rules"); provided, however, that Licensee may
         elect not to participate in such arbitration, in which event this
         License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately. The
         number of arbitrators shall be one unless the Rules require otherwise.

         Unless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All
         documents and information concerning the arbitration shall be public
         and may be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under
         Article 43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely
         manner all documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated
         to it, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted
         into the record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings
         of hearings and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral
         tribunal, subject only to the arbitral tribunal's powers to take such
         measures as may be necessary to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral
         process pursuant to Articles 18, 33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3)
         Article 26(6) of the Rules shall not apply.

      (( 2. ))??
      Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or entity
      for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human Rights
      Laws. "Human Rights Laws" means any applicable laws, regulations, or rules
      (collectively, "Laws") that protect human, civil, labor, privacy,
      political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or similar
      rights; provided, however, that such Laws are consistent and not in
      conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute over the consistency or a
      conflict between Laws and Human Rights Principles shall be determined by
      arbitration as stated above). Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one
      jurisdiction are applicable or in conflict with respect to the use of the
      Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the
      individuals or groups harmed shall apply.

      (( 3. ))??
      Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and any
      other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
      claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties,
      fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor's
      reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee's use
      of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights
      Principles.

   *
   Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the terms and
   conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an
   infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject to
   exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or
   infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by
   Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject.
   Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions
   of this License against Licensee through specific performance (or similar
   remedy under Laws) to the extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in
   the event of a breach of this License, infringement, or as otherwise stated
   in this License, Licensor may not terminate this License with Licensee.

   *
   Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this License
   is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of
   competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability
   shall not affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or
   render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction;
   provided, however, subject to a court modification pursuant to the
   immediately following sentence, if any term or provision of this License
   pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles is deemed invalid,
   illegal, or unenforceable against Licensee by a court of competent
   jurisdiction, all rights in the Software granted to Licensee shall be deemed
   null and void as between Licensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any
   term or provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent
   permitted by Laws, the court may modify this License to affect the original
   purpose that the Software be used in compliance with Human Rights Principles
   and Human Rights Laws as closely as possible. The language in this License
   shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against
   any party.

   *
   Disclaimer. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS,"
   WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR AND ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY
   ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE,
   UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.

This Hippocratic License is an Ethical Source license (https:/ethicalsource.dev)

   Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by
the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that
you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c
for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same
holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is
also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support
for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since
arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman
mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as
we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF
decoders.

We are required to state that

"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe
Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

      setting out a method to replace the Derived Program with the Original
      Program.

      (( (3) ))??
      The Recipient must license the Derived Program under the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement.

(( IBM Public License Version 1.0 ))??

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM

PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION

OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a. ))??
      in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the
      Original Program, and

      (( b. ))??
      in the case of each Contributor,

         (( i. ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii. ))??
         additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the
         Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
         Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was
         added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
         such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
         the Program which:

            (( (i) ))??
            are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with

            the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not

            derivative works of the Program.

   "Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
   necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
   combined with the Program.

   "Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying
   this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and
   documentation, if any.

   "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
   including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
      by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c. ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is

      Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before

      distributing the Program.

      (( d. ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
   its own license agreement, provided that:

      (( a. ))??
      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      (( b. ))??
      its license agreement:

         (( i. ))??
         effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
         conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
         title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         (( ii. ))??
         effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         (( iii. ))??
         states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
         by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         (( iv. ))??
         states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      (( a. ))??
      it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      (( b. ))??
      a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
   Program:

   Copyright (C) __5__ International Business Machines Corporation and
   others. All Rights Reserved.

   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
   Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
   is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
   or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
   time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
   distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
   always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
   was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
   Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
   under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this
   Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
   Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
   Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
   or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
   Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
   in any resulting litigation.

   Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to

   license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
   that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such

      (( d. ))??
      If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
      then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
      of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
      at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
      distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
      display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
      third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
      for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add
      Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
      alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
      the License.

   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
   associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
   tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

   (( 9. ))??
   Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
   to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
   accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims.

         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
         by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
         a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
         describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
         that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
         knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
         Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
         copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
         steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
         that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs.

         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations.

         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
         3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
         Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
         rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Borland Software Corporation (''Interbase'') may publish revised and/or
      new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
      a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Interbase. No one other
      than Interbase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
      Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
      ''NPL", "Interbase", "ISC", "IB'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not
      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
      License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license

      Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
      Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of

      (( 6.4 ))??
      Origin of the Interbase Public License.

      The Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1
      with the following changes:

      The license is published by Borland Software Corporation. Only Borland
      Software Corporation can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.

      The license can be modified used for code which is not already governed by
      this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid
      confusion with Netscape?s or Interbase Software?s license and must include
      a description of changes from the Interbase Public License.

      The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "Interbase Public License".

      The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.

      Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.

      Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted

      A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and
      restricted rights to use the trademarks of Borland Software Corporation

   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
   ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
   permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the

(( Licence Art Libre

[ Copyleft Attitude ]

Version 1.2 ))??

Préambule :

Avec cette Licence Art Libre, l'autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser
et de transformer librement les oeuvres dans le respect des droits de l'auteur.

Loin d'ignorer les droits de l'auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les
protège. Elle en reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un
usage créatif des oeuvres d'art.

Alors que l'usage fait du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique
conduit à restreindre l'accès du public à l'oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a
pour but de le favoriser.

L'intention est d'ouvrir l'accès et d'autoriser l'utilisation des ressources
d'une oeuvre par le plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier
les réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier
les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs avec la
reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral.

En effet, avec la venue du numérique, l'invention de l'internet et des
logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est apparu. Il
est aussi l'amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté par nombre d'artistes
contemporains.

Le savoir et la création sont des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour
être encore véritablement du savoir et de la création. C'est à dire rester
une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une application
concrète. Créer c'est découvrir l'inconnu, c'est inventer le réel avant tout
souci de réalisme.

Ainsi, l'objet de l'art n'est pas confondu avec l'objet d'art fini et défini
comme tel.

C'est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger
des pratiques artistiques libérées des seules règles de l'économie de
marché.

   qui souhaite bénéficier des libertés qu'elle confère sera liée

(( Licence Art Libre 1.3 (LAL 1.3) ))??

Préambule :

Avec la Licence Art Libre, l'autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser et
de transformer librement les œuvres dans le respect des droits de l'auteur.

Loin d'ignorer ces droits, la Licence Art Libre les reconnaît et les protège.
Elle en reformule l'exercice en permettant à tout un chacun de faire un usage
créatif des productions de l'esprit quels que soient leur genre et leur forme
d'expression.

Si, en règle générale, l'application du droit d'auteur conduit à restreindre
l'accès aux œuvres de l'esprit, la Licence Art Libre, au contraire, le
favorise. L'intention est d'autoriser l'utilisation des ressources d'une
œuvre ; créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier les
possibilités de création. La Licence Art Libre permet d'avoir jouissance des
œuvres tout en reconnaissant les droits et les responsabilités de chacun.

Avec le développement du numérique, l'invention d'internet et des logiciels
libres, les modalités de création ont évolué : les productions de l'esprit
s'offrent naturellement à la circulation, à l'échange et aux transformations.
Elles se prêtent favorablement à la réalisation d'œuvres communes que chacun
peut augmenter pour l'avantage de tous.

C'est la raison essentielle de la Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger
ces productions de l'esprit selon les principes du copyleft : liberté d'usage,
de copie, de diffusion, de transformation et interdiction d'appropriation
exclusive.

Définitions :

Nous désignons par « œuvre », autant l'œuvre initiale, les œuvres
conséquentes, que l'œuvre commune telles que définies ci-après :

L'œuvre commune : Il s'agit d'une œuvre qui comprend l'œuvre initiale ainsi
que toutes les contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les
copies). Elle est créée à l'initiative de l'auteur initial qui par cette
licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les contributions sont faites.

L'œuvre initiale : C'est-à-dire l'œuvre créée par l'initiateur de l'œuvre
commune dont les copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite.

Les œuvres conséquentes : C'est-à-dire les contributions des auteurs qui
participent à la formation de l'œuvre commune en faisant usage des droits de
reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur confère la licence.

Originaux (sources ou ressources de l'œuvre) : Chaque exemplaire daté de
l'œuvre initiale ou conséquente que leurs auteurs présentent comme
référence pour toutes actualisations, interprétations, copies ou
reproductions ultérieures.

Copie : Toute reproduction d'un original au sens de cette licence.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so
that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually
obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary
software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.
This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in
full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the
library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running
a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense,
the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library,
and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might
promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.
This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free
programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such
programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have
not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have
achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope
is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
Public License rather than by this special one.

((GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE))??
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also
   called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
   either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
   say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
   code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The modified work must itself be a software library.

      __1__ You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      __1__ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
      application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
      operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
      purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
      Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function
      or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
      not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
   you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
   to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
   License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
   Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
   wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
   corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
   from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
   is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
   License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
   of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
   the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
   precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
   in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
   whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
   object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
   linked directly with the Library itself.

   __1__ As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a
   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
   portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
   provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
   own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
   used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
   must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
   copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
   among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
   License. Also, you must do one of these things:

      __1__ Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
      source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)

      __1__ Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      __1__ If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
      a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      __1__ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
      or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
   include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
   not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
   form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
   accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
   system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
   together in an executable that you distribute.

   __1__ You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
   that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
   other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
   these two things:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
      part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
   the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
   choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
   the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
   Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

(( How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

((GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE))??

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
   which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
   party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
   Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
   either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
   say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
   code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The modified work must itself be a software library.

      __1__ You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      __1__ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
      application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
      operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
   that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
   Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
   by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
   square root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
   you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
   to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
   License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
   Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
   wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
   corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
   from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
   is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
   License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
   of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
   the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
   precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
   in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
   whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
   object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
   linked directly with the Library itself.

   __1__ As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
   portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
   provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
   own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
   used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
   must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
   copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
   among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
   License. Also, you must do one of these things:

      __1__ Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
      source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)

      __1__ Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of
      the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
      copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
      properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one,
      as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
      that the work was made with.

      __1__ Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      __1__ If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
      a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      __1__ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
      or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
   include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed
   need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
   binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
   accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
   system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
   together in an executable that you distribute.

   __1__ You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
   that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
   other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
   these two things:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
      part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
   the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
   choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
   the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
   Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

((How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.

   __1__ Additional Definitions.



      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
      General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
      General Public License.



      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
      than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.



      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
      the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a
      subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
      interface provided by the Library.



      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
      Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
      which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".



      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
      Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
      portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
      the Application, and not on the Linked Version.



      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
      code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and
      utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
      Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   __1__ Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
   being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
   refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
   facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
   then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      __1__ under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
      data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
      purpose remains meaningful, or

      __1__ under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
      License applicable to that copy.

   __1__ Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
   file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
   of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
   numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
   inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
   the following:

      __1__ Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
      License.

      __1__ Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
      license document.

   __1__ Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
   together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
   Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
   such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      __1__ Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
      License.

      __1__ Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
      license document.

      __1__ For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
      notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the
      GNU GPL and this license document.

      __1__ Do one of the following:

         __1__ Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
         and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
         Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
         modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
         GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         __1__ Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
         of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
         will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
         interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      __1__ Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
      required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
      only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
      execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
      relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
      (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the
      Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
      use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
      manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
      Source.)

   __1__ Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
   side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
   Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
   library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
      work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
      uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
   received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
   or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
   Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
   future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
   proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
   authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources

**//

(( Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources ))??

Preamble

The licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change it. By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change free data--to make sure the data are free for all their users.

This License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources,
applies to some specially designated linguistic resources -- typically lexicons
and grammars.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   (( 0. ))??
   This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License for
   Linguistic Resources (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed
   as "you".

   A "linguistic resource" means a collection of data about language prepared so
   as to be used with application programs.

   The "Linguistic Resource", below, refers to any such work which has been
   distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Linguistic Resource"
   means either the Linguistic Resource or any derivative work under copyright
   law: that is to say, a work containing the Linguistic Resource or a portion
   of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Legible form" for a linguistic resource means the preferred form of the
   resource for making modifications to it.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Linguistic Resource is not restricted, and output from such a
   program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Linguistic Resource (independent of the use of the Linguistic Resource in a
   tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the program that
   uses the Linguistic Resource does.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
   publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
   warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Linguistic Resource.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      (( a) ))??
      The modified work must itself be a linguistic resource.

      (( b) ))??
      You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
      you changed the files and the date of any change.

      (( c) ))??
      You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
      third parties under the terms of this License.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Linguistic Resource, and can
   be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Linguistic Resource, the
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
   permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
   and every part regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Linguistic Resource.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Linguistic
   Resource with the Linguistic Resource (or with a work based on the Linguistic
   Resource) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
   other work under the scope of this License.

   (( 3. ))??
   A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic
   Resource, but is designed to work with the Linguistic Resource (or an
   encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) by reading it or being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource". Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, combining a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" with the
   Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates
   a package that is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it
   contains portions of the Linguistic Resource), rather than a "work that uses
   the Linguistic Resource". If the package is a derivative of the Linguistic
   Resource, you may distribute the package under the terms of Section 4. Any
   works containing that package also fall under Section 4.

   (( 4. ))??
   As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a "work that uses
   the Linguistic Resource" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form
   of the Linguistic Resource) to produce a package containing portions of the
   Linguistic Resource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice,
   provided that the terms permit modification of the package for the customer's
   own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the package that the
   Linguistic Resource is used in it and that the Linguistic Resource and its
   use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If
   the package during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Linguistic Resource among them, as well as a
   reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do
   one of these things:

      (( a) ))??
      Accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      legible form of the Linguistic Resource including whatever changes were
      used in the package (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
      above); and, if the package contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic
      Resource, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the
      Linguistic Resource", as object code and/or source code, so that the user
      can modify the Linguistic Resource and then encrypt it to produce a
      modified package containing the modified Linguistic Resource.

      (( b) ))??
      Use a suitable mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource. A
      suitable mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified
      version of the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as
      the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
      package was made with.

      (( c) ))??
      Accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 4a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      (( d) ))??
      If distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      (( e) ))??
      Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
      that you have already sent this user a copy.

   If the package includes an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, the
   required form of the "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" must include
   any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the package from it.
   However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
   include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
   form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
   accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
   Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Linguistic
   Resource together in a package that you distribute.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic
   Resource except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
   under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long
   as such parties remain in full compliance.

   (( 6. ))??
   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
   However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Linguistic Resource or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
   law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
   distributing the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic
   Resource), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
   terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Linguistic
   Resource or works based on it.

   (( 7. ))??
   Each time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the
   Linguistic Resource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Linguistic
   Resource subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
   further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
   with this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
   or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
   imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
   contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
   conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
   simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Linguistic
   Resource at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by all those who
   receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
   could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
   distribution of the Linguistic Resource.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   resource distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   data distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
   that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute resources through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
   that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   (( 9. ))??
   If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Linguistic Resource under this
   License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
   those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as
   if written in the body of this License.

   (( 10. ))??
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Linguistic
   Resource specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Linguistic Resource does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
   Software Foundation.

   (( 11. ))??
   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
   the author to ask for permission.

   NO WARRANTY

   (( 12. ))??
   BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS
   WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
   OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   (( 13. ))??
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
   THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE (INCLUDING BUT NOT
   LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
   BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO OPERATE
   WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a. ))??
      in the case of
      //** <ORGANIZATION> **//
      __5__
      ("
      //** <OWNER> **//

      "), the Original Program, and

      (( b. ))??
      in the case of each Contributor,

         (( i. ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii. ))??
         additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the
         Program originate from and are "Contributed" by that particular
         Contributor.

         A Contribution is "Contributed" by a Contributor only (i) if it was
         added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
         such Contributor's behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly
         consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the
         changes and/or additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include
         additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
         distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
         agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

         "Contributor" means
         //** <OWNER> **//
         __5__
         and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the
         Program.

         "Distributor" means a Recipient that distributes the Program,
         modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

         "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which

         or when combined with the Program.

         "Original Program" means the original version of the software
         accompanying this Agreement as released by
         //** <OWNER> **//
         __5__
         , including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

         "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part
         thereof

         "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
         including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also
      apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the
      Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
      addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not
      apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to
      (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed
      hereunder.

      (( c. ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d. ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

      (( A. ))??
      Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this
      Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

         (( 1. ))??
         it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

         (( 2. ))??
         if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a
         copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is
         included with each copy of the Program; and

         (( 3. ))??
         if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license
         agreement:

            (( a. ))??
            effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

            (( b. ))??
            effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits; and

            (( c. ))??
            states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

      (( B. ))??
      Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in
      the Program:

      Copyright (C) __20__.
      All Rights Reserved.

      (( C. ))??
      In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
      its Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of
      its additions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that
      reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
      Contribution. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
   if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
   Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
   every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
   costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
   actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
   extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
   connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
   offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
   Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
   Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
   Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the
   defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
   may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If
   that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
   related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
   any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor
   must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
   Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
   is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
   or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   //** <OWNER> **//
   __5__
   may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
   version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
   distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
   received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
   Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
   under the new version. No one other than
   //** <OWNER> **//
   __5__
   has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in
   Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
   intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
   expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program
   not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
   //** <STATE> **//
   __5__
   and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
   to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
   one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a
   jury trial in any resulting litigation.

LPPL Version 1.0 1999-03-01

((Copyright __20__))??

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but modification is not allowed.

Preamble

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base
LaTeX distribution is distributed. As described below you may use this licence
for any software that you wish to distribute.

It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a LaTeX
package file) but it may be used for any software, even if it is unrelated to
TeX.

To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit
copyright notice giving your name and the year, together with a reference to
this license.

A typical example would be

%% pig.sty
%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name
% This program can redistributed and/or modified under the terms
% of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN
% archives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; either
% version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply,
with:

` + "`" + `The Program' referring to the software ` + "`" + `pig.sty' and ` + "`" + `The Copyright Holder'
referring to the person ` + "`" + `M. Y. Name'.

To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright notice
for the base latex distribution.

This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed and
modified. Individual files may have specific further constraints on
modification, but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than
those specified below.

This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified
copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this file, and does not
need to check every file in The Program for extra restrictions. If you do need
to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this license,
instead distribute The Program under a different license. You may use the parts
of the text of LPPL as a model for your own license, but your license should not
directly refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is
distributed under the LPPL.

Terms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification

===============================================================

WARRANTY

========

There is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The
Program ` + "`" + `as is' without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The
Copyright Holder, or any of the individual authors named in the source for The
Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out
of inability to use The Program (including but not limited to loss of data or
data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as
a result of a failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even
if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

DISTRIBUTION

============

Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make
up the distribution of The Program are distributed. In particular this means
that The Program has to be distributed including its documentation if
documentation was part of the original distribution.

The distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file listing all the
files covered by this license.

If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!

The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the The
Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed under the following
restrictions:

   *
   It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid
   it. See note below, under "Conditions on individual files".

   *
   You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the file
   explicitly says that renaming is not required. Any such changed files must be
   distributed under a license that forbids distribution of those files, and any
   files derived from them, under the names used by the original files in the
   distribution of The Program.

   *
   You change any ` + "`" + `identification string' in The Program to clearly indicate
   that the file is not part of the standard system.

   *
   If The Program includes an ` + "`" + `error report address' so that errors may be
   reported to The Copyright Holder, or other specified addresses, this address
   must be changed in any modified versions of The Program, so that reports for
   files not maintained by the original program maintainers are directed to the
   maintainers of the changed files.

   *
   You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version in the
   modified file.

   *
   You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or alternatively
   provide sufficient information so that the user of your modified file can be
   reasonably expected to be able to obtain an original, unmodified copy of The
   Program. For example, you may specify a URL to a site that you expect will
   freely provide the user with a copy of The Program (either the version on
   which your modification is based, or perhaps a later version).

   *
   If The Program is intended to be used with, or is based on, LaTeX, then files
   with the following file extensions which have special meaning in LaTeX
   Software, have special modification rules under the license:

      -
      Files with extension ` + "`" + `.ins' (installation files): these files may not be
      modified at all because they contain the legal notices that are placed in
      the generated files.

      -
      Files with extension ` + "`" + `.fd' (LaTeX font definitions files): these files are
      allowed to be modified without changing the name, but only to enable use
      of all available fonts and to prevent attempts to access unavailable
      fonts. However, modified files are not allowed to be distributed in place
      of original files.

      -
      Files with extension ` + "`" + `.cfg' (configuration files): these files can be
      created or modified to enable easy configuration of the system. The
      documentation in cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution describes
      when it makes sense to modify or generate such files.

The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,
the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the
latest version of that file in The Program.

========================================================================

NOTES

=====

We believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make
modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish,
whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of The Program.
If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst adhering to these requirements
then read the document cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution for
suggestions.

Because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like LaTeX,
The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of non-standard versions of
components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them but such
distributions are permitted under the above restrictions.

The document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details the reasons for
the legal requirements detailed above. Even if The Program is unrelated to
LaTeX, the argument in modguide.tex may still apply, and should be read before a
modified version of The Program is distributed.

Conditions on individual files

==============================

The individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the general
conditions on distribution and modification contained in this file. If there are
any such files, the distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file
that lists all the exceptional files.

Typical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would be
files that contain the text of copyright notices.

   *
   The conditions on individual files differ only in the extent of
   *modification* that is allowed.

   *
   The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files. Thus a
   (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The Program need meet only
   the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to check the header of every
   file in the distribution to check that a distribution meets these
   requirements.

modification of it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base
LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to
distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is
TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program
is unrelated to TeX. The section ` + "`" + `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER
THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for
authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, ` + "`" + `The Program' refers to any program distributed under
this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and
conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed.
Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding
conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified
versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or
superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A
distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program
therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not
covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of
running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom
to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with
whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability,
integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your
goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document ` + "`" + `cfgguide.tex' in
the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of
only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice
forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following
eight conditions are met:

   (( 1. ))??
   You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution
   of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection
   ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program'.

   (( 2. ))??
   If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable
   additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file
   that are described below in the subsection ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on LaTeX
   Software Files'.

   (( 3. ))??
   You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original
   file.

   (( 4. ))??
   In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the
   original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.

   (( 5. ))??
   You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly
   that the modified file is not part of The Program.

   (( 6. ))??
   You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of
   errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for
   files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to
   the maintainers of the modified files.

   (( 7. ))??
   You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids
   distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the
   modified file with the filename of the original file.

   (( 8. ))??
   You must do either (A) or (B):

      (( (A) ))??
      distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of
      The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the
      modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a
      designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from
      the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;

      (( (B) ))??
      provide to those who receive the modified file information that is
      sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may
      provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will
      provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version
      from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, ` + "`" + `distribution' of a file means making the file available
to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any
machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself.
` + "`" + `Modification' of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file
under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a
significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files
that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however,
that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,
the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the
latest version of that file of The Program.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal
use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the
modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be
distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have
modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the
modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of
this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The
Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the
behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.

Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program

--------------------------------------------------------

An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement
and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional
conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a
modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program
therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of
those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified
versions of those files.

Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files

---------------------------------------------

If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a
LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement
and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its
filename extension:

   -
   You may not modify any file with filename extension ` + "`" + `.ins' since these are
   installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files
   they generate.

   -
   You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension ` + "`" + `.fd'
   (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as
   described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition
   files with their original names provided that:

      (( (1) ))??
      the only changes to the original files either enable use of available
      fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;

      (( (2) ))??
      you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be
      used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used
      by TeX).

   -
   You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension ` + "`" + `.cfg'
   (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually
   will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular
   configuration file.

Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3
Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX
or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can
meet the conditions of this license.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing,
The Copyright Holder provides The Program ` + "`" + `as is', without warranty of any kind,
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire
risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The
Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair,
or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author
named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or
modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use
of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not
limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE

=========================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for
authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.
These authors are addressed as ` + "`" + `you' in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this
license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a
different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the
impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.

The document ` + "`" + `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the
motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why
distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered
inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in
` + "`" + `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
programs under any license are encouraged to read it.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit
copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the
distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in
this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx
%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name
%
% This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
% The latest version of this license is in
% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
% and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
% version 1999/06/01 or later.
%
% This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this
license document would apply, with ` + "`" + `The Program' referring to the two files
` + "`" + `pig.dtx' and ` + "`" + `pig.ins', and ` + "`" + `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person ` + "`" + `M.
Y. Name'.

Important Recommendations

-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes The Program

The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The
Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to
determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be
achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright
notice of each file or by using a line like

% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for
the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.

Noting Exceptional Files

If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification,
or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed
in ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'), then it is recommended that
The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions,
and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of
exceptional files.

Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of
files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration
files (with filename extension ` + "`" + `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less
restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file.
The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of
declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.

the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of
only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice
forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following
eight conditions are met:

   (( 1. ))??
   You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution
   of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection
   ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program'.

   If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable
   additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file
   that are described below in the subsection ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on LaTeX
   Software Files'.

   (( 3. ))??
   You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original
   file.

   (( 4. ))??
   In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the
   original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.

   (( 5. ))??
   You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly
   that the modified file is not part of The Program.

   (( 6. ))??
   You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of
   errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for
   files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to
   the maintainers of the modified files.

   (( 7. ))??
   You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids
   distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the
   modified file with the filename of the original file.

   (( 8. ))??
   You must do either (A) or (B):

      (( (A) ))??
      distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of
      The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the
      modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a
      designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from
      the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;

      (( (B) ))??
      provide to those who receive the modified file information that is
      sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may
      provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will
      provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version

Note that in the above, ` + "`" + `distribution' of a file means making the file available

` + "`" + `Modification' of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file
under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a
significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file conventions
of the target file systems) is considered to be a modification of the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files
that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however,
that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,
the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the
latest version of that file of The Program.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal
use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the
modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be
distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have

modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of
this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The
Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the
behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.

Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
--------------------------------------------------------

An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement
and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional
conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a
modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program
therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of
those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified
versions of those files.

Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files

---------------------------------------------

If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a
LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement
and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its
filename extension:

   -
   You may not modify any file with filename extension ` + "`" + `.ins' since these are
   installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files
   they generate.

   -
   You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension ` + "`" + `.fd'
   (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as
   described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition
   files with their original names provided that:

      (( (1) ))??
      the only changes to the original files either enable use of available
      fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;

      (( (2) ))??
      you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be
      used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used
      by TeX).

   -
   You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension ` + "`" + `.cfg'
   (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually
   will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular
   configuration file.

Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3
Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX
or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can
meet the conditions of this license.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing,
The Copyright Holder provides The Program ` + "`" + `as is', without warranty of any kind,
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire
risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The
Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair,
or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author
named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or
modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use
of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not
limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
=========================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for
authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.
These authors are addressed as ` + "`" + `you' in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this
license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a
different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the
impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.

The document ` + "`" + `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the
motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why
distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered
inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in
` + "`" + `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
programs under any license are encouraged to read it.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit
copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the
distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in
this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx
%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name
%
% This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
% The latest version of this license is in
% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
% and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
% version 1999/12/01 or later.
%
% This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this
license document would apply, with ` + "`" + `The Program' referring to the two files
` + "`" + `pig.dtx' and ` + "`" + `pig.ins', and ` + "`" + `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person ` + "`" + `M.
Y. Name'.

Important Recommendations

-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes The Program

The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The
Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to
determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be
achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright
notice of each file or by using a line like

% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for
the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.

Noting Exceptional Files If The Program contains any files bearing additional
conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those
files (other than those listed in ` + "`" + `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software
Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that
defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or
defines one or more categories of exceptional files.

Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of
files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration
files (with filename extension ` + "`" + `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less
restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file.
The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of
declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.

PREAMBLE

========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the
the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which
you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your work
is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it with small
modifications even if your work is unrelated to TeX.

The section ` + "`" + `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below,
gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and
modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may
be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom
to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever
technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity,
and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
meeting these conditions, then read the document ` + "`" + `cfgguide.tex' and
` + "`" + `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

DEFINITIONS

===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

` + "`" + `Work' Any work being distributed under this License. ` + "`" + `Derived Work' Any work
that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

` + "`" + `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file
associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

` + "`" + `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
applicable law. ` + "`" + `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one
person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not
limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file
transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's
Network File System (NFS).

` + "`" + `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where
it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using
installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work,
copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification
of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of
the Work.

` + "`" + `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If
there is no such explicit nomination then it is the ` + "`" + `Copyright Holder' under any
applicable law.

` + "`" + `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or
interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on
external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter
provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is
used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the
Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a "LaTeX-Format".

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

   (( 1. ))??
   Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not
   covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act
   of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning
   any offers of support for the Work.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received
   it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the
   Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the
   terms of this clause.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete,
   unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as
   that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may
   install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been
   installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.

   (( 4. ))??
   If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction,
   modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the
   Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the
   Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current
   Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.

   (( 5. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy
   of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this
   Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
   Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of
   the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it
   is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add
   such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.

      (( a. ))??
      If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a
      component of the Work when that component is used with the Base
      Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself
      to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the
      replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously
      identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when
      used interactively with that Base Interpreter.

      (( b. ))??
      Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing
      the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to
      another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that
      contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.

      (( c. ))??
      No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including
      (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work,
      provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and
      handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons
      have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived
      Work.

      (( d. ))??
      You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:

         (( 1. ))??
         A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a
         modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified
         component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
         copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition,
         even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with
         the modified component;

         (( 2. ))??
         Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of
         the Work.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
   Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is
   distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the
   conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,
   the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes
   identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is
   distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

   (( 9. ))??
   Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where
   the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by
   applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections
   of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.

   (( 10. ))??

      (( a. ))??
      A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that
      license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard
      to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions
      in this license.

      (( b. ))??
      If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that Derived Work
      must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each
      recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6
      above, concerning changes from the Work.

   (( 11. ))??
   This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work,
   nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with
   the Work by any means.

   (( 12. ))??
   Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete
   compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the
Copyright Holder provides the Work ` + "`" + `as is', without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The
Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any
other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be
liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to
use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered
inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work
to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author
or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK

=======================

The Work has the status ` + "`" + `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly
and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the
Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that is
` + "`" + `author-maintained'.

The Work has the status ` + "`" + `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has
indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the
Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for
the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.

The Work changes from status ` + "`" + `maintained' to ` + "`" + `unmaintained' if there is no
Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work
cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of
six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.

You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing
Current Maintainer to take over this role.

If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work
through the following steps:

   (( 1. ))??
   Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright
   Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar
   search.

   (( 2. ))??
   If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still
   maintained.

      (( a. ))??
      If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their
      communication data within one month.

      (( b. ))??
      If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is
      taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent
      community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX
      work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

      (( 3a. ))??
      If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of
      the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

      (( b. ))??
      If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees
      that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect
      immediately upon announcement.

   (( 4. ))??
   If you make an ` + "`" + `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after
   three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer
   nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the
   Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

   (( 5. ))??
   If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more
   within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then
   that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon
   request provided they then update their communication data within one month.

A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the
Work is distributed under the LPPL license.

If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately
provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status
as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same
pertinent community as in 2b) above.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE

======================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for
authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These
authors are addressed as ` + "`" + `you' in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions
that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this
license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a
different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the
impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL.

The document ` + "`" + `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the
motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why
distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered
inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in
` + "`" + `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
works under any license are encouraged to read it.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal
use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified
component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be
distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have
modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to
access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the
conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and,
worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best
interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works
provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its
licensed components.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an
explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored
and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the
distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the
conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx
%% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name
%
% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
% The latest version of this license is in
% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
% version 2003/12/01 or later.
%
% This work has the LPPL maintenance status " maintained ".
%
% This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name .
%
% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
% and the derived file pig.sty .

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this
license document would apply, with the ` + "`" + `Work' referring to the three files
` + "`" + `pig.dtx', ` + "`" + `pig.ins', and ` + "`" + `pig.sty' (the last being generated from ` + "`" + `pig.dtx'
using ` + "`" + `pig.ins'), the ` + "`" + `Base Interpreter' referring to any "LaTeX-Format", and
both ` + "`" + `Copyright Holder' and ` + "`" + `Current Maintainer' referring to the person ` + "`" + `M. Y.
Name'.

If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change
"maintained" above into "author-maintained". However, we recommend that you use
"maintained" as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your
Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and
support it yourself.

Important Recommendations

-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes the Work

The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the
Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to
determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved
by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of
each file or by using a line such as:

% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for
the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in
such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to
which files comprise the Work.

DEFINITIONS

===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

` + "`" + `Work' Any work being distributed under this License. ` + "`" + `Derived Work' Any work
that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

` + "`" + `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file
associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

` + "`" + `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
applicable law. ` + "`" + `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one
person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not
limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file
transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's
Network File System (NFS).

` + "`" + `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where
it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using
installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work,
copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification
of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of
the Work.

` + "`" + `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If
there is no such explicit nomination then it is the ` + "`" + `Copyright Holder' under any
applicable law.

` + "`" + `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or
interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.

A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not
considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component
clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly
specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base
Interpreter is a ` + "`" + `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
` + "`" + `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the ` + "`" + `TeX language'.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

   (( 1. ))??
   Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not
   covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act
   of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning
   any offers of support for the Work.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received
   it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the
   Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the
   terms of this clause.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete,
   unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as
   that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may
   install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been
   installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.

   (( 4. ))??
   If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction,
   modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the
   Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the
   Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current
   Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.

   (( 5. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy
   of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this
   Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
   Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of
   the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it
   is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add
   such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.

      (( a. ))??
      If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a
      component of the Work when that component is used with the Base
      Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself
      to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the
      replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously
      identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when
      used interactively with that Base Interpreter.

      (( b. ))??
      Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing
      the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to
      another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that
      contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.

      (( c. ))??
      No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including
      (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work,
      provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and
      handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons
      have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived
      Work.

      (( d. ))??
      You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:

         (( 1. ))??
         A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a
         modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified
         component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
         copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition,
         even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with
         the modified component;

         (( 2. ))??
         Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of
         the Work.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
   Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is
   distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the
   conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to,
   the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes
   identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is
   distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

   (( 9. ))??
   Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where
   the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by
   applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections
   of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.

   (( 10. ))??

      (( a. ))??
      A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that
      license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard
      to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions
      in this license.

      (( b. ))??
      If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived
      Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each
      recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6
      above, concerning changes from the Work.

   (( 11. ))??
   This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work,
   nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with
   the Work by any means.

   (( 12. ))??
   Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete
   compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the
Copyright Holder provides the Work ` + "`" + `as is', without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The
Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any
other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be
liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to
use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered
inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work
to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author
or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK

=======================

The Work has the status ` + "`" + `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly
and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the
Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is
` + "`" + `author-maintained'.

The Work has the status ` + "`" + `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has
indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the
Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for
the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.

The Work changes from status ` + "`" + `maintained' to ` + "`" + `unmaintained' if there is no
Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work
cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of
six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.

You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing
Current Maintainer to take over this role.

If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work
through the following steps:

   (( 1. ))??
   Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright
   Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar
   search.

   (( 2. ))??
   If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still
   maintained.

      (( a. ))??
      If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their
      communication data within one month.

      (( b. ))??
      If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is
      taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent
      community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX
      work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

      (( 3a. ))??
      If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of
      the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

      (( b. ))??
      If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees
      that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect
      immediately upon announcement.

   (( 4. ))??
   If you make an ` + "`" + `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after
   three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer
   nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the
   Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

   (( 5. ))??
   If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more
   within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then
   that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon
   request provided they then update their communication data within one month.

A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the
Work is distributed under the LPPL license.

If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately
provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status
as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same
pertinent community as in 2b) above.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE

======================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for
authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These
authors are addressed as ` + "`" + `you' in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions
that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this
license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a
different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the
impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL.

The document ` + "`" + `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the
motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why
distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered
inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in
` + "`" + `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
works under any license are encouraged to read it.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal
use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified
component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be
distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have
modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to
access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the
conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and,
worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best
interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works
provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its
licensed components.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an
explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored
and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the
distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the
conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx
%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
%
% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
% The latest version of this license is in
% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
% version 2005/12/01 or later.
%
% This work has the LPPL maintenance status " maintained ".
%
% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name .
%
% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
% and the derived file pig.sty .

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this
license document would apply, with the ` + "`" + `Work' referring to the three files
` + "`" + `pig.dtx', ` + "`" + `pig.ins', and ` + "`" + `pig.sty' (the last being generated from ` + "`" + `pig.dtx'
using ` + "`" + `pig.ins'), the ` + "`" + `Base Interpreter' referring to any ` + "`" + `LaTeX-Format', and
both ` + "`" + `Copyright Holder' and ` + "`" + `Current Maintainer' referring to the person ` + "`" + `M. Y.
Name'.

If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change
` + "`" + `maintained' above into ` + "`" + `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use
` + "`" + `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your
Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and
support it yourself.

Derived Works That Are Not Replacements

---------------------------------------

Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability
for the user community. They therefore concern themselves with the case that a
Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or incompatible)
replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines
of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d
shall not apply.

Important Recommendations

-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes the Work

The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the
Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to
determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved
by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of
each file or by using a line such as:

% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for
the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in
such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to
which files comprise the Work.

   Garanties

   Sauf mention contraire, le concédant distribue le logiciel sans aucune

   logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes d'une version spécifique, c'est
   seulement cette version qui liera les parties à la licence.

   actuelle ou toute version ultérieure, auquel cas le licencié peut choisir
   sous quelle version la licence lui est accordée.

**//

(( Licence Libre du Québec – Réciprocité forte (LiLiQ-R+)

Version 1.1 ))??

   (( 1. ))??
   Préambule

   Cette licence s'applique à tout logiciel distribué dont le titulaire du
   droit d'auteur précise qu'il est sujet aux termes de la Licence Libre du
   Québec – Réciprocité forte (LiLiQ-R+) (ci-après appelée la
   « licence »).

   (( 2. ))??
   Définitions

   Dans la présente licence, à moins que le contexte n'indique un sens
   différent, on entend par:

   « concédant » : le titulaire du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel, ou toute
   personne dûment autorisée par ce dernier à accorder la présente licence;

   « contributeur » : le titulaire du droit d'auteur ou toute personne
   autorisée par ce dernier à soumettre au concédant une contribution. Un
   contributeur dont sa contribution est incorporée au logiciel est considéré
   comme un concédant en regard de sa contribution;

   « contribution » : tout logiciel original, ou partie de logiciel original
   soumis et destiné à être incorporé dans le logiciel;

   « distribution » : le fait de délivrer une copie du logiciel;

   « licencié » : toute personne qui possède une copie du logiciel et qui
   exerce les droits concédés par la licence;

   « logiciel » : une œuvre protégée par le droit d'auteur, telle qu'un
   programme d'ordinateur et sa documentation, pour laquelle le titulaire du
   droit d'auteur a précisé qu'elle est sujette aux termes de la présente
   licence;

   « logiciel dérivé » : tout logiciel original réalisé par un licencié,
   autre que le logiciel ou un logiciel modifié, qui produit ou reproduit la
   totalité ou une partie importante du logiciel;

   « logiciel modifié » : toute modification par un licencié de l'un des
   fichiers source du logiciel ou encore tout nouveau fichier source qui
   incorpore le logiciel ou une partie importante de ce dernier.

   (( 3. ))??
   Licence de droit d'auteur

   Sous réserve des termes de la licence, le concédant accorde au licencié
   une licence non exclusive et libre de redevances lui permettant d'exercer les
   droits suivants sur le logiciel:

      (( 1 ))??
      Produire ou reproduire la totalité ou une partie importante;

      (( 2 ))??
      Exécuter ou représenter la totalité ou une partie importante en
      public;

      (( 3 ))??
      Publier la totalité ou une partie importante.

   Cette licence est accordée sans limite territoriale et sans limite de
   temps.

   L'exercice complet de ces droits est sujet à la distribution par le
   concédant du code source du logiciel, lequel doit être sous une forme
   permettant d'y apporter des modifications. Le concédant peut aussi
   distribuer le logiciel accompagné d'une offre de distribuer le code source
   du logiciel, sans frais supplémentaires, autres que ceux raisonnables afin
   de permettre la livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide
   pendant une durée raisonnable.

   (( 4. ))??
   Distribution

   Le licencié peut distribuer des copies du logiciel, d'un logiciel modifié
   ou dérivé, sous réserve de respecter les conditions suivantes :

      (( 1 ))??
      Le logiciel doit être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;

      (( 2 ))??
      Si le logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de
      préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet une
      telle mention;

      (( 3 ))??
      Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état des droits d'auteur, des marques
      de commerce, des garanties ou de la paternité concernant le logiciel ne
      doivent pas être modifiées ou supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes
      ou mentions ne soient inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé
      donné.

   (( 4.1. ))??
   Réciprocité

   Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le concédant offre au
   récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel selon les termes de la
   présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une concession selon les termes
   de la présente licence pour tout logiciel modifié ou dérivé qu'il
   distribue.

   Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, un logiciel modifié, ou
   un logiciel dérivé, ce dernier doit assumer l'obligation d'en distribuer le
   code source, de la manière prévue au troisième alinéa de l'article 3.

   (( 4.2. ))??
   Compatibilité

   Dans la mesure où le licencié souhaite distribuer un logiciel modifié ou
   dérivé combiné à un logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible, mais
   dont il ne serait pas possible d'en respecter les termes, le concédant
   offre, en plus de la présente concession, une concession selon les termes de
   cette licence compatible.

   Un licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel
   assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut pas se prévaloir de cette offre.
   Il en est de même pour toute autre personne dûment autorisée à
   sous-licencier par le titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel
   assujetti à une licence compatible.

   Est considérée comme une licence compatible toute licence libre approuvée
   ou certifiée par la Free Software Foundation ou l'Open Source Initiative,
   dont le niveau de réciprocité est comparable à celui de la présente
   licence, sans toutefois être moindre, notamment:

      (( 1 ))??
      Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL-1.0)

      (( 2 ))??
      Contrat de licence de logiciel libre CeCILL, version 2.1 (CECILL-2.1)

      (( 3 ))??
      Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 (EPL-1.0)

      (( 4 ))??
      European Union Public License, version 1.1 (EUPL v. 1.1)

      (( 5 ))??
      GNU General Public License Version 2 (GNU GPLv2)

      (( 6 ))??
      GNU General Public License Version 3 (GNU GPLv3)

   (( 5. ))??
   Contributions

   Sous réserve d'une entente distincte, toute contribution soumise par un
   contributeur au concédant pour inclusion dans le logiciel sera soumise aux
   termes de cette licence.

   (( 6. ))??
   Marques de commerce

   La licence n'accorde aucune permission particulière qui permettrait
   d'utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre que celle requise
   permettant d'identifier la provenance du logiciel.

   (( 7. ))??
   Garanties

   Sauf mention contraire, le concédant distribue le logiciel sans aucune
   garantie, aux risques et périls de l'acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et
   ce, sans assurer que le logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou
   puisse donner un résultat quelconque.

   Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque manière, rien n'empêche un
   licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des garanties ou du support.

   (( 8. ))??
   Responsabilité

   Le licencié est responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des
   droits accordés par la licence.

   Le concédant ne saurait être tenu responsable du préjudice subi par le
   licencié ou par des tiers, pour quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la
   licence et les droits qui y sont accordés.

   (( 9. ))??

   sont accordés ne sont pas exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont
   stipulés.

   Toutefois, si le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30 jours de sa prise

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims.

         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
         right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under
         this License), you must include a text file with the source code
         distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs.

         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You
         own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that
         API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
      describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one
      or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
      notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
      a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your
      choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
      You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
      for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
   Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4
   and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
      given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL" or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
      otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms
      which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
      (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
      Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves
      be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
   days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
   which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
   SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in
   writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute
   relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and
   binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
   (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara
   County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any
   litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
   the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
   in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
   costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
   or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
   3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies
   of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
   such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected
   parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims

         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
         by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
         a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
         describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
         that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
         knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
         Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
         copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
         steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
         that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs

         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations.

         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
         3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
         are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
         sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
      (( 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 || 3.1 - 3.5 ))
      have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
      stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
      under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
      You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
      conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
      relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
      Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
      given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note
      that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
      clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
      the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the
      name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   Termination

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( a. ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( b. ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. government end users

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Responsibility for claims

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   Multiple-licensed code

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
   permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
   MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer
   in the file described in Exhibit A.

      (( 2.4. ))??
      Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
      (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
      under the terms of Section 3.3).

   Responsibilities

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code
      Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and
      how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
      or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
         of distribution to the recipient; and

         (( (b) ))??
         You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License
      permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the
      terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger
      Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under
      the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Termination

      (( 5.1. ))??
      The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
      basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
      some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
      compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
      reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
      received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor,
      and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the
      notice.

      (( 5.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
      of this License shall terminate.

      (( 5.3. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
      termination shall survive termination.

   (( 6. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
   as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
   any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 7. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
   You.

   (( 8. ))??
   Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   (( 9. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

   (( 10. ))??
   Versions of the License

      (( 10.1. ))??
      New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      (( 10.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

      (( 10.3. ))??
      Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

      (( 10.4. ))??
      Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses

      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

   of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several
   different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

   (( 2. ))??
   Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
   Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The
   terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code"
   are defined in the License.)

   (( 3. ))??
   You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
   create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in
   the License.)

   (( 4. ))??
   By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
   agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then
   distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you
   must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
   providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
   liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or
   causes you any injury or damages.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
   fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed
   Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the
   Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case
the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they
do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice.
If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to
fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to
publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that
consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose
to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those
from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the
License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on
precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are
first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary
at the end of the License.

License Terms ))??

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of License From Licensor.

   Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license,
   subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
      Licensed Product or portions thereof (including Modifications as
      hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as an executable program.
      "Source Code" means the preferred form for making modifications to the
      Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any
      associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation
      and installation of an executable program, or a list of differential
      comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.

      (( b. ))??
      Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch copyright
      law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting from the substance or
      structure of said Licensed Product.

      (( c. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor,
      to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of
      Licensed Product or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any
      such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
      have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions
      thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor.

   "Modifications" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or
   structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file
   that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the
   term "Licensed Product" shall include all previous Modifications that you
   receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section
   4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation
   of, and distributed, a Modification (a "Contributor") hereby grants you a
   world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
   intellectual property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 3. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant.

   Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
   copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of
   Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent
   license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you
   delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product
   with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of
   Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed
   Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
   from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor
   otherwise would have a right to license.

   (( 4. ))??
   Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.

      (( a. ))??
      Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition
      for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any
      Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you
      distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without
      limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you
      contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
      future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include
      a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you
      distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter
      or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering
      the additional rights described in Section 4(e).

      (( b. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of
      this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any
      Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you
      distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a
      mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the
      electronic transfer of data (an "Electronic Distribution Mechanism"). The
      Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you
      distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the
      date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
      subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made
      available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( c. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you
      create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a
      file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or
      contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions,
      changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed
      Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the
      Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed
      by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related
      documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the
      Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright
      notices in the Licensed Product.

      (( d. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( i. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any
         Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall
         promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been
         obtained.

         (( ii. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API") and you have knowledge of patent licenses
         that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( iii. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are
         your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant
         the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( e. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you
      provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to
      which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe
      recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the
      notice contained in Exhibit A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source
      Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a
      Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
      is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to
      its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
      Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you
      alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor
      as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

      (( f. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product
      as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain
      terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the
      requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you
      include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related
      documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code
      version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright
      notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms
      that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or
      any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as
      a result of any terms you offer.

      (( g. ))??
      Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g.,
      combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and
      distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you
      select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the
      Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

   (( 5. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that
   prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
   the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all
   distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient
   of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.

   (( 6. ))??
   Application of This License.

   This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached
   the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of This License.

      (( a. ))??
      Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open
      Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location
      of court.

      (( b. ))??
      New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new
      versions of the License.

      (( c. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a
      particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed
      Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
      by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.

      (( d. ))??
      Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version
      of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software
      that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename
      your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and
      must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this
      License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of
      Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty.

   LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
   LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR
   ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
   LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
   DISCLAIMER.

   (( 9. ))??
   Termination.

      (( a. ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of
      becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that
      are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license.
      Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
      termination of this License, shall survive.

      (( b. ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as
      "Respondent") alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future
      use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent.
      If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
      are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
      claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under
      Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice
      Period.

      (( c. ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( d. ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      licenses to distributors and reselle rs) that have been validly granted by
      you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
      termination.

   (( 10. ))??
   Limitation of Liability.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY

Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for
managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent
operating systems incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in
1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe, and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information

      (( C. ))??
      Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software
      as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator of its

      identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
      requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file)
      that describes the alterations made and the date of the alterations,
      identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and consents to
      characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by

      advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's
      participation in this Agreement.

      (( F. ))??
      ((
      In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject
      Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is
      requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the following
      website: __10__
      Recipient's name and personal information shall be used for statistical
      purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is

      has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.

      (( H. ))??
      A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
      support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other
      Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only
      on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
      Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by
      that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify
      Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by
      them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered
      by such Recipient.

      (( I. ))??
      A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with
      separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and
      distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the
      Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included
      in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

      (( J. ))??
      Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put
      on notice that export of any goods or technical data from the United
      States may require some form of export license from the U.S. Government.
      Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
      liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a
      license shall not be required nor that, if required, it shall be issued.
      Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.

))??

(( Note: This license is derived from the "Artistic License" as distributed with
the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from those of the
"Artistic License."

PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. ))??

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
   such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
      such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
      modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
      get the Standard Version.

      (( b) ))??
      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
      Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
      names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
      equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
      Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
   You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
   charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
   larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
   emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
   shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input
   as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in
   any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

   (( 8. ))??
   The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
   products derived from this software without specific prior written
   permission.

   (( 9. ))??
   THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED

   MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Nethack General Public License

https://opensource.org/licenses/NGPL

(( NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(( Copyright __20__ ))??
))??

(Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license,
but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms
for other programs.

The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those
companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone
the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to
have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights
or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies
of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that
you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you
know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive
anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack,
you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure
that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their
rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that
there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we
distributed.

Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the
following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change
NetHack.

COPYING POLICIES

   (( 1. ))??
   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all
   files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence
   of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy
   of this License Agreement along with the program.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy
   and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
   (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do
   the following:

      (( a) ))??
      cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change; and

      (( b) ))??
      cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
      or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to
      be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those
      contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant
      more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your
      option)

      (( c) ))??
      You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a
      copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
      a fee.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under
   Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs
   1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be
      distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

      (( b) ))??
      accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
      machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This
      alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

   For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
   distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the
   files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
   expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to
   copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
   use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
   terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs
   from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
   so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

Stated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of
NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above; in
particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must
remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other words,
go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else from sharing it
farther.

   modifying the information and/or combining the information with other

   of the information in accordance with the article below relating to
   attribution.

   If the licensor has made available information not covered by the licence
   according to the above list, the licensee must cease all use of the
   information under the licence, and erase the information as soon as he or she
   becomes aware of or should have understood that the information is not

   (( 4. ))??
   Effects of breach of the licence

   The licence is subject to the licensee's compliance with the terms and
   conditions of this licence. In the event that the licensee commits a breach
   of this licence, this will entail that the licensee's right to use the
   information will be revoked immediately without further notice. In case of
   such a breach, the licensee must immediately and without further notice take
   measures to cause the infringement to end. Because the right to use the
   information has been terminated, the licensee must cease all use of the

   changes have been made by the licensee.

   using the information.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of liability

   The information is licensed «as is». The information may contain errors and
   omissions. The licensor provides no warranties, including relating to the
   content and relevance of the information.

   The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and defects associated with
   the information to the maximum extent permitted by law.

   The licensor shall not be liable for direct or indirect losses as a result of
   use of the information or in connection with copying or further distribution
   of the information.

   (( 8. ))??
   Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility

   This licence does not prevent the licensor from issuing supplementary
   statements regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility.
   Such statements shall be regarded as indicative in nature and not binding on
   the part of the licensor. The disclaimers in Section 7 also apply in full for
   such indicative statements. Based on separate agreement, the licensor may
   provide guarantees and distribute the information on terms and conditions
   different from those set forth in this licence.

   (( 9. ))??
   Licence compatibility

   If the licensee is to distribute an adapted or combined work based on
   information covered by this licence and some other work licensed under a
   licence compatible by contract, such distribution may be based on an
   appropriate licence compatible by contract, cf. the list below.

   A licence compatible by contract shall mean the following licences:

   *
   for all information: Open Government Licence (version 1.0),

   *
   for those parts of the information which do not constitute databases:
   Creative Commons Attribution Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and

   *
   for those parts of the information which constitute databases: Open Data
   Commons Attribution License (version 1.0).

   This provision does not prevent other licences from being compatible with
   this licence based on their content.

   (( 10. ))??
   New versions of the licence

   The licensee may choose to use the information covered by this licence under
   any new versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD)
   issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of Government
   Administration, Reform and Church Affairs) when these versions are final and
   official, unless the licensor when making the information available under
   this licence specifically has stated that solely version 1.0 of this licence
   may be used.

   (( 11. ))??
   Governing law and legal venue

This licence, including its formation, and any disputes and claims arising in
connection with or relating to this licence, shall be regulated by Norwegian

         Modifications made by that Contributor.

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims.

         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
         by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
         a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
         describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
         that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
         knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
         Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
         copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
         steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
         that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs.

         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations.

         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
         3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
         Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
         rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single
      (( LEDs ))??
      product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
      License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Netizen Pty Ltd ("Netizen ") may publish revised and/or new versions of
      the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one other
      than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Netizen", "NOSL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
      in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
      License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source License and Xen
      Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
      Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
      not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

      (( 7.1 ))??
      To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided to the
      contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject matter of this
      Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded. Where legislation
      implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty and that legislation
      avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract excluding or modifying the
      application of or the exercise of or liability under such term, such term
      shall be deemed to be included in this Agreement. However, the liability
      of Supplier for any breach of such term shall be limited, at the option of
      Supplier, to any one or more of the following: if the breach related to
      goods: the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the
      repair of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of
      acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the goods
      repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying of the
      services again; or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied
      again.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable.

   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the law of the
   State of Victoria. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive
   jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and any Courts hearing
   appeals from such Courts. This Agreement is deemed to have been made in
   Victoria.

   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
   permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
   NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer
   in the file described in Exhibit A.

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
         intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
         utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the
         source code distribution titled ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
         the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
         know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
         interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
         to implement that API, you must also include this information in the
         LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If
      You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to
      put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
      that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
      license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
   Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4
   and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (` + "`" + `` + "`" + `Netscape'') may
      publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License
      (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license
      so that the phrases ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `Mozilla'', ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `MOZILLAPL'', ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `MOZPL'', ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `Netscape'',
      ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your
      license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape
      Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
      Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
      themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
   days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
   which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
   SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial computer software'' and
   ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

   3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims

         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
         by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
         a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
         describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
         that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
         knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
         Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
         copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
         steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
         that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs

         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations.

         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
         3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
         are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
         sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
      and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
      stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
      under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
      You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
      conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
      relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
      Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
      given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note
      that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
      clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
      the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the
      name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   Termination

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( a. ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( b. ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. government end users

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Responsibility for claims

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial

   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

"License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work")
whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following licensing notice adjacent
to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0

   (( 1) ))??
   Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to
   do the following:

      (( a) ))??
      to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
      collective work;

      (( b) ))??
      to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
      Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon
      the Original Work;

      (( c) ))??
      to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
      Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
      Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed
      under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section
      17(d);

      (( d) ))??
      to perform the Original Work publicly; and

      (( e) ))??
      to display the Original Work publicly.

   (( 2) ))??
   Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled
   by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the
   Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for
   sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

   (( 3) ))??
   Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
   of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
   documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to
   provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
   with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor
   reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
   copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
   permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
   continues to distribute the Original Work.

   (( 4) ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as
   expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
   Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
   for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than
   the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
   trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.
   Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
   licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that
   Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

   (( 5) ))??
   External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
   distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in
   any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone
   other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those
   persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.
   As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat
   any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
   distribution under section 1(c).

   (( 6) ))??
   Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
   cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is
   provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
   express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
   non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
   license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this
   disclaimer.

   (( 8) ))??
   Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
   or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
   or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for
   loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
   all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall
   not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

   (( 9) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
   License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
   License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
   copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
   effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
   the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
   the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
   Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
   and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
   Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
   limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
   terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
   granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in
   Section 1(c).

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original
   Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
   action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with
   other software or hardware.

   (( 11) ))??
   Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and
   under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
   appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
   seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
   recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
   attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
   any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
   such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable.

   (( 14) ))??
   Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
   rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
   of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity.

   (( 15) ))??
   Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
   restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises
   not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

   (( 16) ))??
   Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence
   Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License
   without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this
   License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You
   may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
   modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original
   works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not
   indicate in any way that your Modified License is the "Open Software License"
   or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified
   License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph
   above with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or
   with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in
   this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
   source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source
   Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification
   process.

   (( 17) ))??
   Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software
   License ("OSL 3.0") is "Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0". The original
   OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:

      (( (a) ))??
      Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization
      that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original
      Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating
      thereto.

      (( (b) ))??
      The first sentence of Section 7 ["Warranty of Provenance"] of OSL 3.0 has
      been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0,
      LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

      (( c ))??
      In the first sentence of Section 8 ["Limitation of Liability"] of this
      Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now
      includes "direct" damages.

      (( (d) ))??
      The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this "Non-Profit
      Open Software License" rather than the "Open Software License". You may
      distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof
      under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation
      and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall
      distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof
      only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing
      notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not
      authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL
      3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.

      (( (e) ))??
      Original Works licensed under this license shall reference "Non-Profit OSL
      3.0" in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under
      the original OSL 3.0 license.

      with other software or devices.

   (( 2.2 ))??
   Contributor Grant.

   Subject to the terms of this License and subject to third party intellectual
   property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license

      (( a) ))??
      under copyrights Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,

      Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
      combination).

      (( c) ))??
      The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
      date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Software.

      (( d) ))??

      third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of
      Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part

      Contributor.
      (( 3. ))??
      DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

   (( 3.1 ))??
   Application of License.

   The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
   the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
   Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the
   terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
   Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
   the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
   Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
   License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
   additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

   (( 3.2 ))??
   Availability of Source Code.

   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
   available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
   same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
   Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
   available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
   remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
   became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
   that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
   are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available
   even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
   party.

   (( 3.3 ))??
   Description of Modifications.

   You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
   documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date
   of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
   is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia
   and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice
   in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
   origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

   (( 3.4 ))??
   Intellectual Property Matters

      (( (a) ))??
      Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
      third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
      rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
      must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL"
      which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
      detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains
      such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
      Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
      copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
      (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
      calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new
      knowledge has been obtained.

      (( (b) ))??
      Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
      programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
      which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
      also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      (( c ))??
      Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant
      to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
      Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor
      has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

   (( 3.5 ))??
   Required Notices.

   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
   If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due
   to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a
   relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
   If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
   Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
   this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
   recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. You may
   choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
   liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
   You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any
   Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
   hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability
   incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   (( 3.6 ))??
   Distribution of Executable Versions.

   You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the
   requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and
   if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
   Software is available under the terms of this License, including a
   description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
   3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
   version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
   recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the
   Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of
   Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
   that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
   license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
   recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
   this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
   license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
   this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You
   hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability
   incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
   offer.

   (( 3.7 ))??
   Larger Works.

   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
   software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
   Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
   of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
   (( 4. ))??
   INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order,
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.
(( 5. ))??
APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A
and to related Covered Software.
(( 6. ))??
VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

   (( 6.1 ))??
   New Versions.

   Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
   time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   (( 6.2 ))??
   Effect of New Versions.

   Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the
   License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
   You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any
   subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia
   has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created
   under this License.
   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS
OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
(( 8. ))??
TERMINATION.

   (( 8.1 ))??
   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
   days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software
   which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 8.2 ))??
   If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
   (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia
   or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
   "Participant") alleging that:

      (( a) ))??
      such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
      any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
      under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
      from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
      receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a
      mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
      Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation
      claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
      within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are
      not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections
      2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
      notice period specified above.

      (( b) ))??
      any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
      rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
      are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
      distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

   (( 8.3 ))??
   If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
   such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
   patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior
   to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
   value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
   shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
   or license.

   (( 8.4 ))??
   In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
   license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
   validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
   shall survive termination.
   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT
MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES,
LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing
contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party
dealing as a consumer.
(( 10. ))??
MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are
reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the
trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are
included in any part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be
settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of
Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the
English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable,
it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall
remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
(( 11. ))??
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall
be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

))??

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE CODE BASE
AND/OR DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE (THE "License"), YOU AGREE TO THE
FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.

Section 1. Your Rights

Subject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of
Research (the "Original Contributor") and each subsequent contributor
(collectively with the Original Contributor, the "Contributors") hereby grant
you a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute,
prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for
commercial and noncommercial purposes, the original code contributed by Original
Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called the "Program").

Section 2. Definitions

A "Modification" to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents
of any file of the Program and any new file that contains any part of the
Program. If you make a Modification and distribute the Program externally you
are a "Contributor." The distribution of the Program must be under the terms of
this license including those in Section 3 below.

A "Combined Work" results from combining and integrating all or parts of the
Program with other code. A Combined Work may be thought of as having multiple
parents or being result of multiple lines of code development.

Section 3. Distribution Licensing Terms

   (( A. ))??
   General Requirements

   Except as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party
   restriction (see below), a distribution of the Program in any of the forms
   listed below must not put any further restrictions on the recipient's
   exercise of the rights granted herein.

   As a Contributor, you represent that your Modification(s) are your original
   creation(s) and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim
   (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your
   Modification(s). You represent that each of your Modifications includes
   complete details of any third-party right or other third-party restriction
   associated with any part of your Modification (including a copy of any
   applicable license agreement).

   The Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically
   transferring the files to the recipient.

   This Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be prominently
   displayed with every distribution of the Program in any form:

   YOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
   (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES NO WARRANTIES,
   REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL
   SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO: (A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF
   PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE
   RESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING THE PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A
   COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE
   LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS;
   OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
   WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
   OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES
   OF ANY KIND AGAINST CONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE
   PROGRAM.

   (( B. ))??
   Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code

   If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make
   Modifications (e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by
   recipient. In addition, each source and data file of the Program and any
   Modification you distribute must contain the following notice:

   Copyright (c) __20__
   All rights reserved.

   The contents of this file, as updated from time to time
   by the OCLC Office of Research, are subject to OCLC Research Public License

   is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express
   or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and
   limitations under the License. This software consists of voluntary contributions
   made by many individuals on behalf of OCLC Research. For more information on
   OCLC Research, please see http:/www.oclc.org/research/.

   The Original Code is ____.
   The Initial Developer of the Original Code is ____.
   Portions created by ____ are Copyright (C) ____. All Rights Reserved.
   Contributor(s): ____.

   (( C. ))??
   Requirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code

   If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make
   Modifications (e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by
   recipient and you must include the following statement in appropriate and
   conspicuous locations:

   "Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library
   Center, Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved."

   In addition, the source code must be included with the object code
   distribution or the distributor must provide the source code to the recipient
   upon request.

   (( D. ))??
   Requirements for a Combined Work Distribution

   Distributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and
   must be made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically
   transferring the files to recipient.

   A Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable
   code. The requirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to
   such distributions.

   An "Aggregate Work" is when the Program exists, without integration, with
   other programs on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions
   of an Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of "Program"
   provided in this License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate
   Work. However, the Program contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this
   License. Also, should the Program be extracted from an Aggregate Work, this
   License applies to any use of the Program apart from the Aggregate Work.

   Section 4. License Grant

   For purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other
   licensees hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the
   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license
   to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance,
   develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or
   create derivative works based on your Modifications (and derivative works
   thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive
   termination of this License for any reason.

Section 5. Termination of Rights

This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular
Contributor) automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action
for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the Program) against
such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.

If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations)
under this License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach
within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses
granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted shall
survive such termination.

Section 6. Other Terms

Except for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark
of any of the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant
Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other
proprietary rights notice contained in the Program.

All transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance
with U.S. import/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department
of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or commerce restrictions which might
apply.

Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must
include a provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted
commercial and noncommercial use by any third party.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual
property infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on
you that contradict the conditions of this License, such conditions do not
excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the
Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and
such other conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program
by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you could
not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required
to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program
you have already distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the
issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received the
Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would
be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board.

The provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining
provisions which shall continue in full force and effect. In substitution for
any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar
import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent
permissible under law.

The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the
amended license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new
license is posted. This License grants only the rights expressly stated herein
and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property
of any Contributor.

This License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between
the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except
by the written agreement of the parties. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States
of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

Preamble

The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the
attribution requirements set out in Section 4.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual
material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license
only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with
another license for the contents.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by
other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the
name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the
contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents
or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.

The Licensor (as defined below)

and

You (as defined below)

agree as follows:

   Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to
   make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying

   creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the
   Database or a Derivative Database occurs.

   "Contents" - The contents of this Database, which includes the information,
   independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For
   example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as
   images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

   or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means
   offered under the terms of this License.

   (( 2.0 ))??
   What this License covers

   (( 2.1. ))??
   Legal effect of this document. This License is:

      (( a. ))??
      A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

      (( b. ))??
      A license of the Database Right; and

      (( c. ))??
      An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

   (( 2.2 ))??
   Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database,
   including:

      (( a. ))??
      Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The
      copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but
      does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this
      Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between
      jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which
      is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can
      also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and
      output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;

      (( b. ))??
      Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
      Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
      Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
      Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
      from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not
      infringe any applicable copyright; and

      (( c. ))??
      Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to
      the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this
      access as outlined in this License.

   (( 2.3 ))??
   Rights not covered.

      (( a. ))??
      This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or
      operation of the Database;

      (( b. ))??
      This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database;
      and

      (( c. ))??
      This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.

   (( 2.4 ))??
   Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the
   Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including
   copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this
   License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract)
   in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a
   Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright
   over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one
   single license covering all of the rights over the images.

   (( 3.0 ))??
   Rights granted

   (( 3.1 ))??
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to
   You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under
   Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable
   copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial
   use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the
   relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats
   whether now known or created in the future.

   The rights granted cover, for example:

      (( a. ))??
      Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the
      Contents;

      (( b. ))??
      Creation of Derivative Databases;

      (( c. ))??
      Creation of Collective Databases;

      (( d. ))??
      Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any
      form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a
      part of Collective Databases; and

      (( e. ))??
      Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
      performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
      part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
      Databases.

   (( 3.2 ))??
   Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:

      (( a. ))??
      Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
      the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
      right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License;

      (( b. ))??
      Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
      right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
      scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
      such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
      License; and,

      (( c. ))??
      Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
      royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
      member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
      schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
      under this License.

   (( 3.3 ))??
   The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
   distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this
   Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using
   alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

   (( 4.0 ))??
   Conditions of Use

   (( 4.1 ))??
   The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your
   complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
   conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in
   material breach of its terms.

   (( 4.2 ))??
   Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or
   the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:

      (( a. ))??
      Do so only under the terms of this License;

      (( b. ))??
      Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database
      or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;

      (( c. ))??
      Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer
      to this License; and

      (( d. ))??
      If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due
      to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as
      a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.

   (( 4.3 ))??
   Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does
   not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a
   Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work
   reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses,
   interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that
   Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database
   as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this
   License.

      (( a. ))??
      Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

      Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available under the
      ODC Attribution License.

      DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
      hyperlink to the location of the Database. "ODC Attribution License"
      should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
      hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
      required URI's with the above notice.

   (( 4.4 ))??
   Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You
   communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or
   any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the
   recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this
   License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
   with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a
   Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a
   Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may
   not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
   affirmed under this License.

   (( 5.0 ))??
   Moral rights

   (( 5.1 ))??
   Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be
   identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would
   otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other
   derogatory treatment:

      (( a. ))??
      For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all
      moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent
      possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;

      (( b. ))??
      If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction
      is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the
      Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent
      possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

      (( c. ))??
      For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
      rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
      over certain aspects of the Database.

      Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
      rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
      jurisdictions.

   (( 6.0 ))??
   Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected

   (( 6.1 ))??
   This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
   independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database,
   including without limitation:

      (( a. ))??
      Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
      non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of
      illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or
      Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial
      procedure.

      (( b. ))??
      Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
      exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.

   (( 6.2 ))??
   This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and
   Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or
   qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative
   Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
   repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts
   of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
   Substantial part of the Contents.

   (( 7.0 ))??
   Warranties and Disclaimer

   (( 7.1 ))??
   The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of
   any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of
   dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied
   warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or
   completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular
   purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
   exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

   (( 8.0 ))??
   Limitation of liability

   (( 8.1 ))??
   Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
   Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or
   damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License,
   whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part
   of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not
   limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary
   damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost
   business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the
   possibility of such damages.

   (( 8.2 ))??
   If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct
   financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of
   the Licensor.

   (( 9.0 ))??
   Termination of Your rights under this License

   (( 9.1 ))??
   Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically
   terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For
   the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or
   a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as
   part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their
   licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this
   License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1,
   2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License.

   (( 9.2 ))??
   If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not
   terminate Your rights under it.

   (( 9.3 ))??
   Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the
   duration of applicable rights in the Database.

   (( 9.4 ))??
   Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions
   of this License, then your full rights under this License will be
   reinstated:

      (( a. ))??
      Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day
      after cessation of breach;

      (( b. ))??
      Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
      reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

      (( c. ))??
      Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this
      is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License
      from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
      receipt of the notice.

   (( 9.5 ))??
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
   Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making
   available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms
   or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License
   (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
   terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
   effect unless terminated as stated above.

   (( 10.0 ))??
   General

   (( 10.1 ))??
   If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that
   must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
   and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License
   shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

   (( 10.2 ))??
   This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
   rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier
   understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.

   (( 10.3 ))??
   If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled
   to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the
   Licensor.

   (( 10.4 ))??
   Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws
   of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
   enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright
   law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional
   rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in
   this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

(( ODC Open Database License (ODbL) ))??

(( Preamble

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users
to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same
freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this
document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European
Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses
these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users
of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual
material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL
only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for
the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers
all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights,
Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the
individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by
other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the
name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the
contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents
or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.

      Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
      the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
      right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License;

      (( b. ))??
      Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
      right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
      scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
      such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
      License; and,

      (( c. ))??
      Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
      royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
      member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
      schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
      under this License.

   (( 3.3 ))??
   The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
   distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this
   Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using
   alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

   (( 4.0 ))??
   Conditions of Use

   (( 4.1 ))??
   The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your
   complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
   conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in
   material breach of its terms.

   (( 4.2 ))??
   Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or
   the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:

      (( a. ))??
      Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted
      under Section 4.4;

      (( b. ))??
      Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted
      under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the
      Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or
      Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and

      (( c. ))??
      Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer
      to this License.

      (( d. ))??
      If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due
      to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as
      a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.

   (( 4.3 ))??
   Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does
   not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a
   Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work
   reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses,
   interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that
   Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database
   as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this
   License.

      (( a. ))??
      Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

      Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here
      under the Open Database License (ODbL).

      DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
      hyperlink to the URI of the Database. "Open Database License" should
      contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks
      are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI's
      with the above notice.

   (( 4.4 ))??
   Share alike.

      (( a. ))??
      Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms
      of:

         (( i. ))??
         This License;

         (( ii. ))??
         A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or

         (( iii. ))??
         A compatible license.

         If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
         mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.

      (( b. ))??
      For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a
      Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative
      Database and must comply with Section 4.4.

      (( c. ))??
      Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly
      Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from
      the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.

      (( d. ))??
      Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must
      not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are
      incompatible with the rights granted under this License.

      (( e. ))??
      Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
      compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised
      proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You
      permission to use the compatible license.

   (( 4.5 ))??
   Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in the
   following:

      (( a. ))??
      For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective
      Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a
      Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to
      this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective
      Database;

      (( b. ))??
      Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a
      Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative
      Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and

      (( c. ))??
      Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to
      the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section
      4.4.

   (( 4.6 ))??
   Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative Database or
   a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also offer to recipients
   of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy in a machine readable form
   of:

      (( a. ))??
      The entire Derivative Database; or

      (( b. ))??
      A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the
      method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm),
      including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences
      between the Database and the Derivative Database.

      The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
      available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
      distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.

   (( 4.7 ))??
   Technological measures and additional terms

      (( a. ))??
      This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7
      b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative
      Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or
      restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or
      have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to
      exercise those rights.

      (( b. ))??
      Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological measures on
      the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of
      the Contents (a "Restricted Database") in contravention of Section 4.74 a.
      only if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database
      available to the recipient of the Restricted Database:

         (( i. ))??
         That is available without additional fee;

         (( ii. ))??
         That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms
         of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or
         intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those
         rights (an "Unrestricted Database"); and

         (( iii. ))??
         The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as
         a practical matter as the Restricted Database.

      (( c. ))??
      For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative
      Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a
      similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict
      the terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the
      effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise
      those rights.

   (( 4.8 ))??
   Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You
   communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or
   any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the
   recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this
   License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
   with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a
   Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a
   Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may
   not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
   affirmed under this License.

   (( 5.0 ))??
   Moral rights

   (( 5.1 ))??
   Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be
   identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would
   otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other
   derogatory treatment:

      (( a. ))??
      For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all
      moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent
      possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;

      (( b. ))??
      If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction
      is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the
      Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent
      possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

      (( c. ))??
      For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
      rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
      over certain aspects of the Database.

      Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
      rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
      jurisdictions.

   (( 6.0 ))??
   Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected

   (( 6.1 ))??
   This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
   independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database,
   including without limitation:

      (( a. ))??
      Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
      non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of
      illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or
      Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial
      procedure.

      (( b. ))??
      Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
      exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.

   (( 6.2 ))??
   This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and
   Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or
   qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative
   Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
   repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts
   of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
   Substantial part of the Contents.

   (( 7.0 ))??
   Warranties and Disclaimer

   (( 7.1 ))??
   The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of
   any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of
   dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied
   warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or
   completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular
   purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
   exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

   (( 8.0 ))??
   Limitation of liability

   (( 8.1 ))??
   Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
   Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or
   damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License,
   whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part
   of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not
   limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary
   damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost
   business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the
   possibility of such damages.

   (( 8.2 ))??
   If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct
   financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of
   the Licensor.

   (( 9.0 ))??
   Termination of Your rights under this License

   (( 9.1 ))??
   Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically
   terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For
   the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or
   a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as
   part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their
   licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this
   License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1,
   2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License.

   (( 9.2 ))??
   If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not
   terminate Your rights under it.

   (( 9.3 ))??
   Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the
   duration of applicable rights in the Database.

   (( 9.4 ))??
   Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions
   of this License, then your full rights under this License will be
   reinstated:

      (( a. ))??
      Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day
      after cessation of breach;

      (( b. ))??
      Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
      reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

      (( c. ))??
      Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this
      is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License
      from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
      receipt of the notice.

      Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be
      a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.

   (( 9.5 ))??
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
   Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making
   available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms
   or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License
   (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
   terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
   effect unless terminated as stated above.

   (( 10.0 ))??
   General

   (( 10.1 ))??
   If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that
   must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
   and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License
   shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

   (( 10.2 ))??
   This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
   rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier
   understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.

   (( 10.3 ))??
   If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled
   to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the
   Licensor.

   (( 10.4 ))??
   Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws
   of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
   enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright
   law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional
   rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in
   this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

(( The Open Group Test Suite License ))??

(( Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based
products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and
protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly
reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application
software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps
development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and
suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the
integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of
the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of
modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license
requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so
we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues
with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees). ))??

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,

there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   (( 1. ))??

   executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the
   differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on
   where to get the Standard Version.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
   You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
   charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a

   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold

should be read.))??

(( PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. ))??

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
   such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
      such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
      modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
      get the Standard Version.

      (( b) ))??
      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
      Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
      names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
      equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
      Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
   You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
   charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
   larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
   emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
   shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input
   as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in
   any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

      this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
      accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer
      of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact
      means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer
      will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an
      Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made
      available.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
         intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
         utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the
         source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and
         the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
         know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If
      You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to
      put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
      that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
      license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute
      executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice
      in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
      product.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that
   prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
   the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
   distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient
   of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of
      the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for
      certification.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to
      modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License,
      except in association with the required Developer Specific License
      described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to
      code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must
      (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `Open'', ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `OpenPL'', ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `OPL''
      or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
      terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of
      the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

      (( 6.4. ))??
      Required Additional Developer Specific License

      text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the

      the higher numbered part.

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT

   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK

   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER

   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1 ))??
      Termination upon Breach

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
      patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
      Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
      against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
      alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
   SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial computer software'' and
   ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered
         by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for
         any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
         additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability
         specific to any jurisdiction.

         (( 3.5.2 ))??
         You may place additional conditions upon the rights granted in this
         License to the extent necessary due to statute, judicial order,
         regulation (including without limitation state and federal procurement
         regulation), national security, or public interest. Any such additional
         conditions must be clearly described in the notice provisions required
         under Section 3.4. Any alteration of the terms of this License will
         apply to all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You or by
         any downstream recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
   License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
   the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices
   required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
   regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
   ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Termination

      (( 5.1 ))??
      Failure to Comply

      The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
      basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
      some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into
      compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
      reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
      received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor,
      and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the
      notice.

      (( 5.2 ))??
      Patent Infringement Claims

      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and
      //** cross-claims **//
      __5__
      ) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
      patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the
      Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      (( 5.3 ))??
      Additional Compliance Terms

      Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this
      Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section
      3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a
      Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as
      described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after
      receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the
      Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License
      on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than
      three (3) years.

      (( 5.4 ))??
      Contributor Remedies

      If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter
      become compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable,
      Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any
      other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking
      injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement
      (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where
      available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would
      otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.

      (( 5.5 ))??
      End User License Agreements

      In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license
      agreements (excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly
      granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
      termination shall survive termination.

   (( 6. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
   as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
   any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 7. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
   You.

   (( 8. ))??
   Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   (( 9. ))??
   Government Terms

      (( 9.1 ))??
      Commercial Item

      The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
      "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
      227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users

         state government, this License shall be governed by the law of such
         state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the adjudication
         of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive
         jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in such state.

         (( 9.3.2 ))??
         If You are an agency of the United States federal government, or Your
         use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with
         such an agency, this License shall be governed by federal law for all
         purposes, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License
         will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts
         located in Washington, D.C.

         (( 9.3.3 ))??
         You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License as
         described in Section 3.5.2.

      (( 9.4 ))??
      Supremacy

      This Section 9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal
      Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other
      clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software
      under this License.

   (( 10. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to
   construe this License against a Contributor.

      New Versions

      The Open Source Election Technology Foundation ("OSET") (formerly known as

   distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by
   placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information
   repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access
   by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and
   by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice

   Work.

   (( 4) ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No
   patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of

   (( 5) ))??
   External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use or
   distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that

   those persons, made available as an application intended for use over a
   computer network, or used to provide services or otherwise deliver content to
   anyone other than You. As an express condition for the grants of license
   hereunder, You agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a
   distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
   prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

   Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE COPYRIGHT IN
   AND TO THE ORIGINAL WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK
   IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A VALID CURRENT LICENSE FROM THE COPYRIGHT
   OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE
   ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT

   FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
   LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
   APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 8) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another written
   agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
   Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and any attempt to do so
   except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between
   Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the

   by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein,
   You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and

Open Software License v. 2.0 ))??

This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the

Work:

Licensed under the Open Software License version 2.0

      (( a) ))??
      to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

      (( b) ))??
      to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
      Work;

      (( c) ))??
      to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
      public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works
      that You distribute shall be licensed under the Open Software License;

      (( d) ))??
      to perform the Original Work publicly; and

      (( e) ))??

   (( 2) ))??
   Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
   claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
   Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
   Original Work and Derivative Works.

   (( 3) ))??
   Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
   of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
   documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
   agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
   Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
   Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
   machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
   reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
   as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by
   publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately
   following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

   (( 4) ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.
   Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
   copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of
   Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to
   make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than
   the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the
   trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.
   Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
   licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that
   Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

   (( 5) ))??
   External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use or
   distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that
   the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You,
   whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those
   persons or made available as an application intended for use over a computer
   network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
   agree that any External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be
   deemed a distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this
   License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

   (( 6) ))??
   Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
   cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
   copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
   Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS"
   BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
   WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part
   of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except
   under this disclaimer.

   (( 8) ))??
   Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of
   this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
   damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
   or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
   liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
   from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not
   apply to You.

   (( 9) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
   a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances
   to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
   Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor
   and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the
   Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein,
   and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another
   written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S.
   copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
   treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section
   1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms
   and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no
   longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your
   failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a
   patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a
   patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the
   Original Work with other software or hardware).

   (( 11) ))??
   Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and
   under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17
   U.S.C. 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
   treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
   damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
   its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
   fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal
   of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable.

   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
   rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control"

   of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity.

   Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
   restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises
   not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

(( Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & License (PDDL) ))??

Preamble

The Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document
intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose
and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or
their contents ("data"), either together or individually.

Many databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe,
have specific special rights that cover databases called the "sui generis"
database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used
to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty
for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a
limited amount of rights under a "some rights reserved" approach to licensing as
outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a
result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to
eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any
Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form
a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms
of use for the database or data.

The position of the recipient of the work

Because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as
possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements
placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work
commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database
with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them
secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a
copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database
as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator
of the data and database on the use of it by others.

The position of the dedicator of the work

Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of "intellectual
property", is inherently national law. This means that there exists several
differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or
licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much
harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other
communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and
thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving
intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use
by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law,
this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and
claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas
of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.

The purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into
the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free
cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to
"dual license" their work by releasing the same work under different licences.
This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they
choose. Rightsholders therefore can't re-license it under copyright or database
rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so
creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the
progress of science and the arts.

This document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the
data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content - not just factual
data - rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication
& Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be
placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes
have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to
cover both the database and its factual data when making material available
under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by
copyright or database rights.

Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database
rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by
other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to
the "Work", which can be either - or both - the database and its contents. As a
result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this
document when they dedicate it.

Just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property,
rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please
ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under
this document.

This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public
for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is
prepared for this to happen.

Part I: Introduction

The Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as
follows:

   (( 1.0 ))??
   Definitions of Capitalised Words

   "Copyright" - Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights
   and similarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant
   jurisdiction under Section 6.4.

   independent works, or other material collected into the Database offered
   under the terms of this Document.

   "Database" - A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way
   and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the
   terms of this Document.

   "Database Right" - Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III
   ("sui generis") rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96/9/EC of the
   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
   protection of databases) and any future updates as well as any similar rights
   available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4.

   back up licence agreement.

   "Person" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or
   incorporate.

   "Use" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or

   mode or format. This includes the right to sublicense the Work.

   "Work" - Means either or both of the Database and Data offered under the
   terms of this Document.

   "You" - the Person acquiring rights under the licence elements of this
   Document.

   Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.

   (( 2.0 ))??
   What this document covers

   (( 2.1. ))??
   Legal effect of this Document. This Document is:

      (( a. ))??
      A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright and Database
      Rights over the Work; and

      (( b. ))??
      A licence of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions
      that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver.

   (( 2.2. ))??
   Legal rights covered.

      (( a. ))??
      Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright law
      varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model
      or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the
      Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the
      data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data stored in the
      Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on the jurisdiction
      and type of Data; and

      (( b. ))??
      Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the extraction and
      re-utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database
      Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database.
      Database Rights can also apply when the Data is removed from the Database
      and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any
      applicable copyright.

   (( 2.2 ))??
   Rights not covered.

      (( a. ))??
      This Document does not apply to computer programs used in the making or
      operation of the Database;

      (( b. ))??
      This Document does not cover any patents over the Data or the Database.
      Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document for further details; and

      (( c. ))??
      This Document does not cover any trade marks associated with the Database.
      Please see Section 4.3 later in this Document for further details.

      Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other
      rights or consult other licences.

   (( 2.3 ))??
   Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position that factual information
   is not covered by Copyright. This Document however covers the Work in
   jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the Work by
   Copyright, and to cover any information protected by Copyright that is
   contained in the Work.

Part II: Dedication to the public domain

   (( 3.0 ))??
   Dedication, waiver, and licence of Copyright and Database Rights

   (( 3.1 ))??
   Dedication of Copyright and Database Rights to the public domain. The
   Rightsholder by using this Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain
   for the benefit of the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and
   Database Rights over the Work.

      (( a. ))??
      The Rightsholder realises that once these rights are relinquished, that
      the Rightsholder has no further rights in Copyright and Database Rights
      over the Work, and that the Work is free and open for others to Use.

      (( b. ))??
      The Rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and
      future rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether
      they are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of
      rights covers all their heirs and successors.

      The above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media
      and formats now known or created in the future.

   (( 3.2 ))??
   Waiver of rights and claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1
   dedication inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in
   the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any
   rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the future
   over the Work in:

      (( a. ))??
      Copyright; and

      (( b. ))??
      Database Rights.

      To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of
      rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now
      known or created in the future. The Rightsholder agrees not to assert the
      above rights and waives the right to enforce them over the Work.

   (( 3.3 ))??
   Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when Sections 3.1 and 3.2
   inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not
   apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and
   You agree as follows:

      (( a. ))??
      The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
      licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright and
      Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do
      not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant
      jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats
      whether now known or created in the future.

   (( 3.4 ))??
   Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be
   identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that would
   otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other
   derogatory treatment:

      (( a. ))??
      For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all
      moral rights that Licensor may have in the Work to the fullest extent
      possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4;

      (( b. ))??
      If waiver of moral rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction
      is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the
      Work and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible
      by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and

      (( c. ))??
      For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
      rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
      over the copyrighted aspects of the Work.

      Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
      rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some
      jurisdictions.

   (( 4.0 ))??
   Relationship to other rights

   (( 4.1 ))??
   No other contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available
   to You without any other contractual obligations, either express or implied.
   Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not a contract and
   does not form part of this Document.

   (( 4.2 ))??
   Relationship to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any
   patents that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned
   that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences.

   (( 4.3 ))??
   Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not grant You a licence for
   any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own or that the Rightsholder may
   use to cover the Work. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may
   have to clear other rights or consult other licences.

Part III: General provisions

   (( 5.0 ))??
   Warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability

   (( 5.1 ))??
   The Work is provided by the Rightsholder "as is" and without any warranty of
   any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or
   completeness, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose,
   or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
   warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

   (( 5.2 ))??
   Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
   Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for
   loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this

   exemplary damages. This exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been
   advised of the possibility of such damages.

   (( 5.3 ))??

   financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of
   the Rightsholder.

   (( 3. ))??
   DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to
      anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the Initial
      Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial
      Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source if a contact
      means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and
      may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to
      be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification
      available and to notify the Initial Developer.
      (http:/sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
         intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
         utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the
         source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and
         the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
         know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
         interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
         to implement that API, you must also include this information in the
         LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If
      You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice
      in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
      include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file)
      where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to
      offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

      However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
      Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear
      that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
      that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
      license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must
      reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other
      materials provided with the product.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from
   adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You
   will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is
   granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or
   regulation.

   (( 5. ))??
   APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products
   becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
   additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.

   Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat
   Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license
   Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License.
   Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms available.

   (( 6. ))??
   VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red
      Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and
      subsequent Licenses.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License
      (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license
      so that the phrases "ECOS", "eCos", "Red Hat", "RHEPL" or any confusingly
      similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise
      make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ
      from the Red Hat eCos Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit
      A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being
granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor's Software,
whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by
providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any
Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same
(collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your
Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source
Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of
everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

   (( a. ))??
   Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms
   of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software
   distribution containing programs from several different sources without
   payment of a royalty or other fee.

   (( b. ))??
   Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted
   by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty
   whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the
   Licensed Software doesn't work properly or causes You any injury or damages.

   (( c. ))??
   Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted
   by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You
   Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License,
   document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from
   the Licensed Software.

   (( d. ))??
   Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations for Your customers.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

   (( a. ))??
   Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions,
   other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and
   distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical
   media.

   (( b. ))??
   Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or
   License text in the Licensed Software.

   (( c. ))??
   Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would
   in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed
   Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or
   Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically
   terminate.

   (( d. ))??
   Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that
   You represent Licensor or

   Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association
   by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

   (( a. ))??
   Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the
   nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change.
   This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file
   titled "CHANGES" distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.

   (( b. ))??
   Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely
   fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP
   download.

   (( c. ))??
   Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in
   a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the
   Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire
   the Source Code and future updates.

   (( d. ))??
   Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or
   controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense,
   and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License. ))??

      hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed
      Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Licensed Software.

   (( 6.0 ))??
   Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition
   to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any
   Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively
   Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
   terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any
   Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under
   the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
   Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide,
   non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights
   You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create
   derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any
   Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily
   tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You
   must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You
   distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or
   executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or
   restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
   hereunder.

      (( 6.1 ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of
      this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions
      that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable
      or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution
      Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its
      Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of
      Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the
      Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy,
      whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
      version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code
      distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of
      duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution
      involve physical media.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You
      create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled "CHANGES"
      distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or
      deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of
      any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a
      cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each
      change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are
      derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include
      the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in
      (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed
      Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe
      the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or
      delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text
      in the Licensed Software.

      (( 6.3 ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( a. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions
         available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the
         LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take
         other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed
         Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( b. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming
         interface ("API") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this
         information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your
         original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the
         rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 6.4 ))??
      Required Notices.

         (( a. ))??
         License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You
         provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to
         which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients' rights relating
         to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in
         EXHIBIT A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source Code of any copy
         You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You
         create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text
         file titled "CONTRIB" distributed with the Licensed Software along with
         a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the
         Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
         must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
         file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

         (( b. ))??
         Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month
         of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to
         Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which
         you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and
         instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions
         on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change
         you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1)
         month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor
         directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news
         groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would
         reasonably be expected to index them.

      (( 6.5 ))??
      Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
      Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
      on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered
      by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every

      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 12.4 ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under

PREAMBLE

The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or,
if you prefer, fairness.

In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open
source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software
and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their
improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred
any time an entity did not release their application to a "third party".

While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the
authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to
the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes,
extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently
finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and
faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.

While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of
the RPL is found in two definitions: "Deploy" and "Required Components".

Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc.
must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in
any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the
software you have to start sharing the software.

Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts,
source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single binary
or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have
to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.

In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the
Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of
this document.

      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( a. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, You must include a human-readable file with
         Your distribution that describes the claim and the party making the
         claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.

         (( b. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming
         interface ("API") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this
         information in a human-readable file supplied with Your distribution.

         (( c. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your

      Required Notices.

         (( a. ))??
         License Text. You must duplicate this License or instructions on how to
         acquire a copy in any documentation You provide along with the Source
         Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever
         You describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Software.

         (( b. ))??
         License Notice. You must duplicate any notice contained in EXHIBIT A
         (the "License Notice") in each file of the Source Code of any copy You
         distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create
         an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the Source Code
         and accompanying documentation along with a description of the
         contribution. If it is not possible to put the License Notice in a
         particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
         such License Notice in a location where a user would be likely to look
         for such a notice.

         (( c. ))??
         Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the
         availability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of
         the date You initially Deploy and include in such notification a
         description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the
         Source Code. Should such instructions change you must notify the
         software community of revised instructions within one (1) month of the
         date of change. You must provide notification by posting to appropriate
         news groups, mailing lists, weblogs, or other sites where a publicly
         accessible search engine would reasonably be expected to index your
         post in relationship to queries regarding the Licensed Software and/or
         Your Extensions.

         (( d. ))??
         User-Visible Attribution. You must duplicate any notice contained in
         EXHIBIT B (the "User-Visible Attribution Notice") in each user-visible
         display of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions which delineates
         copyright, ownership, or similar attribution information. If You create
         an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor, and add Your
         attribution notice, as an equally visible and functional element of any
         User-Visible Attribution Notice content. To ensure proper attribution,
         You must also include such User-Visible Attribution Notice in at least
         one location in the Software documentation where a user would be likely
         to look for such notice.

      (( 6.5 ))??
      Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
      Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
      on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor except as permitted under
      other agreements between you and Licensor or Contributor. You must make it
      clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor
      and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and
      related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor
      or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability terms You offer.

      (( 6.6 ))??
      Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by
      virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar
      circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that
      license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions
      available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to
      conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor
      for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains
      consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be
      granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

   (( 7.0 ))??
   Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised
   versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a
   particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
   the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software
   under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
   Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
   applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.

      (( 7.1 ))??
      If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do
      only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed
      Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is
      not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your
      license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your
      license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor.
      Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of a)
      Section 13.8 solely to modify the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for
      disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define License Notice text, or c) to
      EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible Attribution Notice, You may
      continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or
      simply the RPL.

   (( 10.0 ))??
   High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT
   DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE
   CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE,

   WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD
   DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL
   DAMAGE ("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY
   DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK
   ACTIVITIES.

   (( 11.0 ))??
   Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party
   is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims
   warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be
   used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of
   Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
   use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby
   disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable
   for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such
   responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this
   License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall
   be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   (( 12.0 ))??
   Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate
   immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if
   applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically
   complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any
   of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed
   Software.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of
      becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software
      that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
      Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
      termination of this License, shall survive.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as
      "Respondent") alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future
      use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such
      Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment
      arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
      litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You
      under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said
      Notice Period.

      (( 12.3 ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 12.4 ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to
      distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any
      distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   (( 13.0 ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a "commercial item,"
      as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
      documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
      227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed
      Software with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal association
      between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not
      represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance,
      or otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's
      right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute
      technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or
      otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market,
      or distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to
      enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
      future enforcement of that or any other provision.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
      the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for
      You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
      or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or
      regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or
      otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or
      any underlying information or technology by United States and other
      applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining
      the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance
      with all applicable laws and regulations.

      (( 13.8 ))??
      Arbitration, Jurisdiction & Venue. This License shall be governed by
      Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
      provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You
      expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be
      submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the
      American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County,
      Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding
      jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute
      under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be
      entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
      arbitrator shall award attorney's fees and costs of arbitration to the
      prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its
      arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil
      court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
      reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury
      trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any
      law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be
      construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

      (( 13.9 ))??
      Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between
      the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
         copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as
         they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
         Original Code that refer to this License;

         (( (b) ))??
         You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code
         of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer
         or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
         Section 6;

         (( c ))??
         You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
         in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications,
         and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         You changed the files and the date of any change;

         (( (d) ))??
         You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications
         publicly available under the terms of this License, including the
         license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy
         the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial
         Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the
         Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g.
         download from a web site); and

         (( (e) ))??
         if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You
         must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in
         related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
         available under the terms of this License with information on how and
         where to obtain such Source Code. You must also include the Object Code
         Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the "about" box or other appropriate
         place where other copyright notices are placed, including any packaging
         materials.

      (( 2.2 ))??
      You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each
      Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
      Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or
      any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or
      other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each
      Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
      license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import or offer for
      sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such
      license(s).

      (( 2.3 ))??
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
      grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading
      or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this
      License), a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent
      license under Licensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale and import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance
      you comply with the terms of this License.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License:

      (( (a) ))??
      You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual,
      irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and
      other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make,
      sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify,
      distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as
      Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

      (( (b) ))??
      You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable
      Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled
      by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display,
      perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its
      subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form
      and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution.

      (( c ))??
      You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the
      Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions
      that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting
      any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its
      patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 4. ))??
   Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code
   with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and
   distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such
   instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
   for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.

      (( 4.1 ))??
      You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or
      Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from
      the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other
      license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code
      available for the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications,
      described in Sections 2 and 3, above.

      (( 4.2 ))??
      Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently
      developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of
      the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or
      combined in any way
      //** with **//
      __5__
      the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative Work,
      are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the
      extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked
      to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software
      module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible
      Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be
      subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work
      must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a
      Compatible Source License for any independently developed software modules
      within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the
      Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module to
      link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject
      to the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public
      License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software
      that is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered
      Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code
      not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to
      enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an
      acceptable open source license. You are responsible for determining
      whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your
      license to such software.

      (( 4.3 ))??
      Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the
      Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
      scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination
      and/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for
      example, via automatic updating technology), such combination and/or
      integration constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this
      License.

   (( 5. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as
   expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or
   any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing
   in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
   under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise
   would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use
   or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or
   third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which
   Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted
   separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with
   other software or hardware.

      (( 5.1. ))??
      Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
      or trade names owned by Licensor ("Licensor Marks" defined in Exhibit C)
      or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No
      Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the
      Original Code other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy
      defined in Exhibit C.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
   more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
   behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any
   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
   Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
   defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason
   of any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of
   this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
   version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
   version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
   subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than
   Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
   under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
   pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may
   contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
   incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
   use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire
   risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR
   SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY
   REFERRED TO AS "LICENSOR" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL
   CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
   CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
   THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
   INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS
   CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION
   OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN
   THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION,
   INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
   OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered
   Code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not
   limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear
   facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air
   traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could
   lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
   Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE
   OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,
   WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
   STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH
   CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND
   NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME
   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event
   shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be
   required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten
   dollars ($10.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title
   and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on
   behalf of Licensor ("Licensor Modifications"), and such Licensor
   Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor
   may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications
   under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this
   License or may choose not to license them at all.

   (( 11. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 11.1 ))??
      Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless
      terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with
         any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days
         of becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         12.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during
         the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a
         lawsuit);

         (( (d) ))??
         upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term
         of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any
         third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding
         combinations with other software or hardware) infringes any patent
         (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit).

      (( 11.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
      of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in
      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 12. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
      Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not
      represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance
      or otherwise.

      (( 12.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's
      right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market
      and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 12.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce
      any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 12.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 12.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle,
      Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 12.7 ))??
      Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws
      and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the
      Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not
      export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof
      in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all
      necessary authorizations.

      (( 12.8 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of Washington.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rédigés en anglais.

         portions thereof); and (ii) the combination of Modifications made by
         that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
         combination).

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Governed Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or
      via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Governed Code to which
      you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
      create that Governed Code and the date of any change. You must include a
      prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
      indirectly, from Original Code provided by RSV and including the name of
      RSV in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Governed Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( 3.4.1. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
         intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
         utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the
         source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and
         the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
         know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing
         lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
         the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained. In the event
         that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in
         the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to
         the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but
         not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your
         Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete
         details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of
         your Modifications.

         (( 3.4.2. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
         interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
         to implement that API, you must also include this information in the
         LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Governed Code. If
      You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to
      put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      RSV or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code
      in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
      been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice
      stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available
      under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
      You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
      conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version,
      related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
      rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable
      Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by RSV or any Contributor. You
      hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability
      incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
      offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Governed Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of theterms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
   Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4
   and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Trademark Usage.

      (( 5.1. ))??
      Advertising Materials. All advertising materials mentioning features or
      use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: "This
      product includes software developed by Ricoh Silicon Valley, Inc."

      (( 5.2. ))??
      Endorsements. The names "Ricoh," "Ricoh Silicon Valley," and "RSV" must
      not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works
      without the prior written permission of RSV.

      (( 5.3. ))??
      Product Names. Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called
      "Ricoh" nor may the word "Ricoh" appear in their names without the prior
      written permission of RSV.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. RSV may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
      from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
      number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Governed Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Governed Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by RSV.
      No one other than RSV has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Governed Code created under this License.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty.

   GOVERNED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE GOVERNED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
   ANY GOVERNED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT RSV OR ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
   LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY GOVERNED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Governed Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate patent infringement litigation against RSV or a
      Contributor (RSV or the Contributor against whom You file such action is
      referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
         such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
         shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
         in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty
         for Your past and future use of the Original Code or the Modifications
         made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
         respect to the Original Code or the Contributor Version against such
         Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device provided to You by the Participant,
         other than such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version,
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to
         You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
         effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
         had made, Original Code or the Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
      Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   Limitation of Liability.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
   DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
   LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
   ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL RSVS LIABILITY UNDER OR
   RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED
   CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS
   TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY DANGEROUS APPLICATION
   THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE OR MASS
   DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE
   ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED
   CODE.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. Government End Users.

   The Governed Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to personal jurisdiction
   in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under or
   related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California. The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including
   without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive
   relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent
   jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
   for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
   regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
   against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Responsibility for Claims.

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
   3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies
   of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
   such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected
   parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

      redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered Code in
      source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can include a
      text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this
      License must appear in related documentation or collateral where the
      Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described. Any Additional

      Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the
      terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any
      of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source code
      and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a
      license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
      necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor of
      Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's choosing, containing
      terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include
      this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not
      be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient
      elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient must make it
      absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License are
      offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this
      License is a limited license, and, regardless of the license form employed
      by Recipient in accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense
      only such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has
      actually been granted by SGI in this License.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability
      incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms
      Recipient offers.

   (( 4. ))??
   Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such
   breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code that is
   properly granted shall survive any termination of this License, absent
   termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their
   nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall
   survive.

   (( 5. ))??
   No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to: (i)
   any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
   licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
   otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark or
   service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for
   purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered
   Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or
   ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI.
   All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this License are
   reserved.

   (( 6. ))??
   Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws,
   regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered Code,
   including without limitation export, re-export, and import control laws,
   regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other
   countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
   regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered Code
   that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual
   property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches
   any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which,
   under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.

   (( 7. ))??
   Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any
   disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially
   infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient will
   promptly notify SGI of such claim.

   (( 8. ))??
   Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once
   Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
   Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it under the
   terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
   any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of
   Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to
   Covered Code created under this License.

   (( 9. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS AND
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,

   THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
   NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
   SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

   (( 11. ))??
   Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
   directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
   Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.

   modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or out of any
   representation or warranty made by Recipient.

   this License.

   State of California), with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred

      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may

      Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
      choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
      You are in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute
      the Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make
      it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
      offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to

      Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

      In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user license
      agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly

   Distribution Obligations.

   (( 3.1 ))??
   Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
   contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
   limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
   distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
   License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
   License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer
   or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
   applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
   However, You may include an additional document offering the additional
   rights described in Section 3.5.

   (( 3.2 ))??
   Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
   You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
   this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
   accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
   Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
   Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
   after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
   after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
   available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the
   Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
   Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   (( 3.3 ))??
   Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
   contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
   Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
   statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
   Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
   Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
   Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin
   or ownership of the Covered Code.

   (( 3.4 ))??
   Intellectual Property Matters.

   (( (a) ))??
   Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under
   a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
   rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
   must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL"
   which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
   that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
   knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section
   3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
   Contributor makes available thereafter.

   (( (b) ))??
   Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
   programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses
   which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
   include this information in the LEGAL file.

   (( c ))??
   Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
   Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
   are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
   rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

   (( 3.5 ))??
   Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of
   the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
   Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be most likely to
   look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
   add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must
   also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where
   You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
   However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
   Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
   any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
   You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
   Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from
   intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the
   Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   (( 3.6 ))??
   Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
   Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
   that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
   version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
   including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of
   Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
   Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
   recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
   Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of
   Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
   that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
   license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
   recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
   this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
   license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
   this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
   Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
   Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from
   intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the
   Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
   offer.

   (( 3.7 ))??
   Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
   requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
   must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
   possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
   description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
   must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the
   Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered
   Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

   (( 6.1 ))??
   New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the "SNIA") may
   publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
   version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   (( 6.2 ))??
   Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
   particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
   the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
   the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No
   one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to
   Covered Code created under this License.

   (( 6.3 ))??
   Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
   (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
   Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
   that the phrases "Storage Networking Industry Association," "SNIA," or any
   confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
   your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
   Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public
   License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
   Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
   deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
   IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
   DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
   INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

   (( 8.1 ))??
   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within a
   reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
   Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
   License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 8.2 ))??
   If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
   (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
   Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
   action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: o (a) such
   Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
   patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
   Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
   Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
   of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
   agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
   made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect
   to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed
   upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the
   rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
   automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
   specified above.

   (( 8.3 ))??
   If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
   such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
   patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior
   to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
   value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
   shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
   or license.

   (( 8.4 ))??
   In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
   license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
   validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
   shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
   WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
      contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the
         claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
         If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API"../) and Contributor has knowledge of
         patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
         Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or
      new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
      a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun.
      No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
      (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license
      so that the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL"../ or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note
      that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
      clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
      the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
      Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
      not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "../AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Server Side Public License

VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

Copyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
))??

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   (( 0. ))??
   Definitions.

   "This License" refers to Server Side Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   (( 1. ))??
   Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used
   among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   (( 2. ))??
   Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The output from running a covered
   work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,
   constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use
   or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate covered works that you
   do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
   in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
   having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
   facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms
   of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control
   copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
   exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that
   prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
   their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   (( 3. ))??
   Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   (( 4. ))??
   Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   (( 5. ))??
   Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      (( a) ))??
      The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
      giving a relevant date.

      (( b) ))??
      The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
      this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
      modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

      (( c) ))??
      You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
      who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply,
      along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the
      work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License
      gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      (( d) ))??
      If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
      Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do
      not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do
      so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
   other parts of the aggregate.

   (( 6. ))??
   Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      (( a) ))??
      Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
      physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source
      fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
      interchange.

      (( b) ))??
      Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
      physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for
      at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or
      customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the
      object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
      software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
      physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
      source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network
      server at no charge.

      (( c) ))??
      Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
      offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
      only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
      code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      (( d) ))??
      Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
      or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
      in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
      require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
      code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
      Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a
      third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.

      (( e) ))??
      Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall
   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to
   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed
   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
   the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   (( 7. ))??
   Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      (( a) ))??
      Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
      sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      (( b) ))??
      Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
      attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      (( c) ))??
      Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
      that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
      different from the original version; or

      (( d) ))??
      Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
      of the material; or

      (( e) ))??
      Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
      trademarks, or service marks; or

      (( f) ))??
      Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
      anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
   terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
   apply either way.

   (( 8. ))??
   Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   (( 9. ))??
   Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants
   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
   to do so.

   (( 10. ))??
   Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
   with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   (( 11. ))??
   Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
   extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means
   you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying
   the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in
   a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country
   that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   (( 12. ))??
   No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use, propagate or
   convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
   this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
   terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those
   to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
   terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
   Program.

   (( 13. ))??
   Offering the Program as a Service.

   If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available
   to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code
   available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of
   this License. Making the functionality of the Program or modified version
   available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation,
   enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or
   modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the
   value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or
   modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the
   primary purpose of the Program or modified version.

   "Service Source Code" means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the
   modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use
   to make the Program or modified version available as a service, including,
   without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program
   interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software,
   storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an
   instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available.

   (( 14. ))??
   Revised Versions of this License.

   MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side
   Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
   to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
   concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public License
   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
   published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number
   of the Server Side Public License, you may choose any version ever published
   by MongoDB, Inc.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
   Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
   the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   (( 15. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   (( 16. ))??
   Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 17. ))??
   Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
   all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
   assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
   fee.

Simple Public License 2.0
https://spdx.org/licenses/SimPL-2.0.json
https://opensource.org/licenses/SimPL-2.0
**//

(( Simple Public License (SimPL) ))??

(( Preamble

This Simple Public License 2.0 (SimPL 2.0 for short) is a plain language
implementation of GPL 2.0. The words are different, but the goal is the same -
to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change software. If anyone
wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent
with GPL 2.0. ))??

(( Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0 ))??

The SimPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any
rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by
copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.

You get the royalty free right to:

   -
   Use the software for any purpose;

   -
   Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");

   -
   Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the
community by:

   -
   Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;

   -
   Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license
   terms in place;

   -
   Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface
   definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;

   -
   Licensing it to everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as
   GPL 2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided;

   -
   Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:

   -
   You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;

   -
   If the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages
   up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything).
   You may not recover any other damages, including those called "consequential
   damages." (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit
   your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);

The SimPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end
automatically if:

   -
   You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees
   get to keep their rights if they abide);

   -
   Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the
   SimPL.

License for the License

You may do anything that you want with the SimPL text; it's a license form to
use in any way that you find helpful. To avoid confusion, however, if you change
the terms in any way then you may not call your license the Simple Public
License or the SimPL (but feel free to acknowledge that your license is "based
on the Simple Public License").

         (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
         Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
      You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
      of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made
      an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
      that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
         which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
         also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
         Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
      for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
      Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
      any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
      in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      SugarCRM. No one other than SugarCRM has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
      (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license
      so that the phrases "SugarCRM", "SPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do
      not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from
      this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the
      license contains terms which differ from the SugarCRM Public License.
      (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
      Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves
      be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
   permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
   SPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer
   in the file described in Exhibit A.

(( The TAPR Open Hardware License Version 1.0 (May 25, 2007)
(( Copyright __20__ ))??
))??

PREAMBLE

Open Hardware is a thing - a physical artifact, either electrical or mechanical
- whose design information is available to, and usable by, the public in a way
that allows anyone to make, modify, distribute, and use that thing. In this
preface, design information is called "documentation" and things created from it
are called "products."

The TAPR Open Hardware License ("OHL") agreement provides a legal framework for
Open Hardware projects. It may be used for any kind of product, be it a hammer
or a computer motherboard, and is TAPR's contribution to the community; anyone
may use the OHL for their Open Hardware project.

Like the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee your
freedom to share and to create. It forbids anyone who receives rights under the
OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to copy, modify, and distribute
documentation, and to make, use and distribute products based on that
documentation.

Unlike the GPL, the OHL is not primarily a copyright license. While copyright
protects documentation from unauthorized copying, modification, and
distribution, it has little to do with your right to make, distribute, or use a
product based on that documentation. For better or worse, patents play a
significant role in those activities. Although it does not prohibit anyone from
patenting inventions embodied in an Open Hardware design, and of course cannot
prevent a third party from enforcing their patent rights, those who benefit from
an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their
patents or other intellectual property.

The OHL addresses unique issues involved in the creation of tangible, physical
things, but does not cover software, firmware, or code loaded into programmable
devices. A copyright-oriented license such as the GPL better suits these
creations.

How can you use the OHL, or a design based upon it? While the terms and
conditions below take precedence over this preamble, here is a summary:

   *
   You may modify the documentation and make products based upon it.

   *
   You may use products for any legal purpose without limitation.

   *
   You may distribute unmodified documentation, but you must include the
   complete package as you received it.

   *
   You may distribute products you make to third parties, if you either include
   the documentation on which the product is based, or make it available without
   charge for at least three years to anyone who requests it.

   *
   You may distribute modified documentation or products based on it, if you:

      *
      License your modifications under the OHL.

      *
      Include those modifications, following the requirements stated below.

      *
      Attempt to send the modified documentation by email to any of the
      developers who have provided their email address. This is a good faith
      obligation - if the email fails, you need do nothing more and may go on
      with your distribution.

   *
   If you create a design that you want to license under the OHL, you should:

      *
      Include this document in a file named LICENSE (with the appropriate
      extension) that is included in the documentation package.

      *
      If the file format allows, include a notice like "Licensed under the TAPR
      Open Hardware License (www.tapr.org/OHL)" in each documentation file.
      While not required, you should also include this notice on printed circuit
      board artwork and the product itself; if space is limited the notice can
      be shortened or abbreviated.

      *
      Include a copyright notice in each file and on printed circuit board
      artwork.

      *
      If you wish to be notified of modifications that others may make, include
      your email address in a file named "CONTRIB.TXT" or something similar.

   *
   Any time the OHL requires you to make documentation available to others, you
   must include all the materials you received from the upstream licensors. In
   addition, if you have modified the documentation:

      *
      You must identify the modifications in a text file (preferably named
      "CHANGES.TXT") that you include with the documentation. That file must
      also include a statement like "These modifications are licensed under the
      TAPR Open Hardware License."

      *
      You must include any new files you created, including any manufacturing
      files (such as Gerber files) you create in the course of making products.

      *
      You must include both "before" and "after" versions of all files you
      modified.

      *
      You may include files in proprietary formats, but you must also include
      open format versions (such as Gerber, ASCII, Postscript, or PDF) if your
      tools can create them.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Introduction

   (( 1.1 ))??
   This Agreement governs how you may use, copy, modify, and distribute
   Documentation, and how you may make, have made, and distribute Products based
   on that Documentation. As used in this Agreement, to "distribute"
   Documentation means to directly or indirectly make copies available to a
   third party, and to "distribute" Products means to directly or indirectly
   give, loan, sell or otherwise transfer them to a third party.

   (( 1.2 ))??
   "Documentation" includes:

      (( (a) ))??
      schematic diagrams;

      (( (b) ))??
      circuit or circuit board layouts, including Gerber and other data files
      used for manufacture;

      (( c ))??
      mechanical drawings, including CAD, CAM, and other data files used for
      manufacture;

      (( (d) ))??
      flow charts and descriptive text; and

      (( (e) ))??
      other explanatory material.

   Documentation may be in any tangible or intangible form of expression,
   including but not limited to computer files in open or proprietary formats
   and representations on paper, film, or other media.

   (( 1.3 ))??
   "Products" include:

      (( (a) ))??
      circuit boards, mechanical assemblies, and other physical parts and
      components;

      (( (b) ))??
      assembled or partially assembled units (including components and
      subassemblies); and

      (( c ))??
      parts and components combined into kits intended for assembly by others;
      which are based in whole or in part on the Documentation.

   (( 1.4 ))??
   This Agreement applies to any Documentation which contains a notice stating
   it is subject to the TAPR Open Hardware License, and to all Products based in
   whole or in part on that Documentation. If Documentation is distributed in an
   archive (such as a "zip" file) which includes this document, all files in
   that archive are subject to this Agreement unless they are specifically
   excluded. Each person who contributes content to the Documentation is
   referred to in this Agreement as a "Licensor."

   (( 1.5 ))??
   By (a) using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Documentation, or (b)
   making or having Products made or distributing them, you accept this
   Agreement, agree to comply with its terms, and become a "Licensee." Any
   activity inconsistent with this Agreement will automatically terminate your
   rights under it (including the immunities from suit granted in Section 2),
   but the rights of others who have received Documentation, or have obtained
   Products, directly or indirectly from you will not be affected so long as
   they fully comply with it themselves.

   (( 1.6 ))??
   This Agreement does not apply to software, firmware, or code loaded into
   programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with Documentation or
   Products. Such software is subject to the license terms established by its
   copyright holder(s).

2. Patents

   (( 2.1 ))??
   Each Licensor grants you, every other Licensee, and every possessor or user
   of Products a perpetual, worldwide, and royalty-free immunity from suit under
   any patent, patent application, or other intellectual property right which he
   or she controls, to the extent necessary to make, have made, possess, use,
   and distribute Products. This immunity does not extend to infringement
   arising from modifications subsequently made by others.

   (( 2.2 ))??
   If you make or have Products made, or distribute Documentation that you have
   modified, you grant every Licensor, every other Licensee, and every possessor
   or user of Products a perpetual, worldwide, and royalty-free immunity from
   suit under any patent, patent application, or other intellectual property
   right which you control, to the extent necessary to make, have made, possess,
   use, and distribute Products. This immunity does not extend to infringement
   arising from modifications subsequently made by others.

   (( 2.3 ))??
   To avoid doubt, providing Documentation to a third party for the sole purpose
   of having that party make Products on your behalf is not considered
   "distribution,"\" and a third party's act of making Products solely on your
   behalf does not cause that party to grant the immunity described in the
   preceding paragraph.

   (( 2.4 ))??
   These grants of immunity are a material part of this Agreement, and form a
   portion of the consideration given by each party to the other. If any court
   judgment or legal agreement prevents you from granting the immunity required
   by this Section, your rights under this Agreement will terminate and you may
   no longer use, copy, modify or distribute the Documentation, or make, have
   made, or distribute Products.

3. Modifications

You may modify the Documentation, and those modifications will become part of
the Documentation. They are subject to this Agreement, as are Products based in
whole or in part on them. If you distribute the modified Documentation, or
Products based in whole or in part upon it, you must email the modified
Documentation in a form compliant with Section 4 to each Licensor who has
provided an email address with the Documentation. Attempting to send the email
completes your obligations under this Section and you need take no further
action if any address fails.

4. Distributing Documentation

   (( 4.1 ))??
   You may distribute unmodified copies of the Documentation in its entirety in
   any medium, provided that you retain all copyright and other notices
   (including references to this Agreement) included by each Licensor, and
   include an unaltered copy of this Agreement.

   (( 4.2 ))??
   You may distribute modified copies of the Documentation if you comply with
   all the requirements of the preceding paragraph and:

      (( (a) ))??
      include a prominent notice in an ASCII or other open format file
      identifying those elements of the Documentation that you changed, and
      stating that the modifications are licensed under the terms of this
      Agreement;

      (( (b) ))??
      include all new documentation files that you create, as well as both the
      original and modified versions of each file you change (files may be in
      your development tool's native file format, but if reasonably possible,
      you must also include open format, such as Gerber, ASCII, Postscript, or
      PDF, versions);

      (( c ))??
      do not change the terms of this Agreement with respect to subsequent
      licensees; and

      (( (d) ))??
      if you make or have Products made, include in the Documentation all
      elements reasonably required to permit others to make Products, including
      Gerber, CAD/CAM and other files used for manufacture.

5. Making Products

   (( 5.1 ))??
   You may use the Documentation to make or have Products made, provided that
   each Product retains any notices included by the Licensor (including, but not
   limited to, copyright notices on circuit boards).

   (( 5.2 ))??
   You may distribute Products you make or have made, provided that you include
   with each unit a copy of the Documentation in a form consistent with Section
   4. Alternatively, you may include either (i) an offer valid for at least
   three years to provide that Documentation, at no charge other than the
   reasonable cost of media and postage, to any person who requests it; or (ii)
   a URL where that Documentation may be downloaded, available for at least
   three years after you last distribute the Product.

6. NEW LICENSE VERSIONS

TAPR may publish updated versions of the OHL which retain the same general
provisions as the present version, but differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns, and carry a distinguishing version number. If the Documentation
specifies a version number which applies to it and "any later version", you may
choose either that version or any later version published by TAPR. If the
Documentation does not specify a version number, you may choose any version ever
published by TAPR. TAPR owns the copyright to the OHL, but grants permission to
any person to copy, distribute, and use it in unmodified form.

7. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS

   (( 7.1 ))??
   THE DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED ON AN"AS-IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY
   DISCLAIMED.

   (( 7.2 ))??
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ANY LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
   YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO
   USE, THE DOCUMENTATION OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLAIMS OF
   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR LOSS OF DATA, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS
   BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7.3 ))??
   You agree that the foregoing limitations are reasonable due to the
   non-financial nature of the transaction represented by this Agreement, and
   acknowledge that were it not for these limitations, the Licensor(s) would not
   be willing to make the Documentation available to you.

   (( 7.4 ))??
   You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold each Licensor harmless from any
   claim brought by a third party alleging any defect in the design,
   manufacture, or operation of any Product which you make, have made, or
   distribute pursuant to this Agreement.

   for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than
   the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
   trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.
   Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
   licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that
   Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

   (( 5) ))??
   External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
   distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in
   any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone
   other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those
   persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.
   As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat
   any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
   distribution under section 1(c).

   (( 6) ))??
   Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
   cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
   copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
   Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS"
   BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
   for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
   WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part
   of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 8) ))??
   Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
   the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
   of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
   apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

   (( 9) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
   License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
   License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
   copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
   effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
   the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
   the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
   Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
   and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
   Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
   limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
   terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
   granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in
   Section 1(c).

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original
   Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
   action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with
   other software or hardware.

   (( 11) ))??
   Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and
   under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
   appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
   seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
   recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
   attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
   any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
   such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable.

   (( 14) ))??
   Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
   rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
   of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity.

   (( 15) ))??
   Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
   restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises
   not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

   (( 16) ))??
   Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2005 Lawrence
   Rosen and Copyright (c) 2017 Nigel Tzeng. Permission is granted to copy,
   distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
   License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or
   to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and
   copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the "Modified
   License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the
   following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified
   License is the "Open Software License" or "OSL" or the "Upstream
   Compatibility License" or "UCL" and you may not use those names in the name
   of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the
   first paragraph above with the notice "Licensed under
   (( <insert your license name here> ))??
   " or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice
   in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are
   open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open
   Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and
   certification process.

(( VIM LICENSE ))??

   (( I) ))??
   There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   except that they must include this license text. You can also distribute
   unmodified parts of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , likewise unrestricted except that they must include this license text. You
   are also allowed to include executables that you made from the unmodified
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.

   (( II) ))??
   It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , including executables and/or source code, when the following four
   conditions are met:

      (( 1) ))??
      This license text must be included unmodified.

      (( 2) ))??
      The modified
      //** Vim **//
      __5__
      must be distributed in one of the following five ways:

         (( a) ))??
         If you make changes to
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
         you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the
         modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         you distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,
         available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the
         right to include your changes in the official version of
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         . What the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license
         they will be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no
         negotiation then this license, or a later version, also applies to your
         changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If
         this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
         vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely
         impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your
         changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received
         your changes they will not have to be sent again.

         (( b) ))??
         If you have received a modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         that was distributed as mentioned under a) you are allowed to further
         distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional
         changes the text under a) applies to those changes.

         (( c) ))??
         Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the
         modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         you distribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. You can
         choose what license to use for new code you add. The changes and their
         license must not restrict others from making their own changes to the
         official version of
         //** Vim **//
         __5__

         (( d) ))??
         When you have a modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         which includes changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it
         without the source code for the changes if the following three
         conditions are met:

            -
            The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            without fee or restriction.

            -
            You keep the changes for at least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            . When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you
            must make them available to him.

            -
            You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This
            contact information must remain valid for at least three years after
            last distributing the corresponding modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            , or as long as possible.

         (( e) ))??
         When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you
         can distribute the modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version.

      (( 3) ))??
      A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" command
      and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified
      //** Vim **//
      __5__
      is able to see that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under
      2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does not
      conflict with the license used for the changes.

      (( 4) ))??
      The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
      removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.

   (( III) ))??
   If you distribute a modified version of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your changes and make them
   available to the maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to
   do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the
   URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing
   a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
   <maintainer@vim.org>

   (( IV) ))??
   It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license for
   previous
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   releases instead of the license that they came with, at your option.

   copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:

      (( 2.1 ))??
      You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original
      Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and
      development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance:

         (( (a) ))??
         You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
         copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as
         they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
         Original Code that refer to this License; and

         (( (b) ))??
         You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy of
         Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You
         may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or
         restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as
         permitted under Section 6.

         (( c ))??
         Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this
         License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance
         by clicking on an "I accept" button or similar mechanism. If a
         click-wrap format is not included, you must include a statement that
         any use (including without limitation reproduction, modification or
         distribution) of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you
         define, constitutes acceptance of the License, and instructing the user
         not to use the Covered Code in any manner if the user does not accept
         all of the terms and conditions of the License.

      (( 2.2 ))??
      You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code,
      provided that in each instance:

         (( (a) ))??
         You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
         Source Code of the Covered Code;

         (( (b) ))??
         You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
         in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications,
         and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         You changed the files and the date of any change;

         (( c ))??
         You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly
         available under the terms of this License, including the license grants
         set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered
         Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment,
         whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code
         of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web
         site);

         (( (d) ))??
         if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You
         must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in
         related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
         available under the terms of this License with information on how and
         where to obtain such Source Code; and

         (( (e) ))??
         the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your
         own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains
         terms no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms
         of this License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this
         License are offered by You alone and not by any other party.

      (( 2.3 ))??
      You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each
      Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
      Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any
      Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each
      Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
      license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
      Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Covered Code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all third parties a
   non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and
   other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by
   You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your
   Modifications of the same scope and extent as Sybase's licenses under
   Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

   (( 4. ))??
   Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any
   portion thereof.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no
   other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein.
   Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
   Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with this License ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered
   Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
   responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. You must
   obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered
   by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and
   every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted
   against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions of
   this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
   version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
   version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
   subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No one other than
   Sybase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
   under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
   pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may
   contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
   incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
   use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire
   risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR
   SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND SYBASE AND SYBASE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY
   REFERRED TO AS "SYBASE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL
   CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
   CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
   THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
   INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS
   CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION
   OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN
   THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE
   GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL
   CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for
   use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation,
   communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the
   failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
   physical or environmental damage.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL SYBASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF
   OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE,
   OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SYBASE OR
   SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND
   NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME
   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
   TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase's or any Contributor's total liability to
   You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
   this License exceed the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Sybase" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to
   Sybase (collectively "Sybase Marks") or to any trademark or trade name
   belonging to any Contributor("Contributor Marks"). No Sybase Marks or
   Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the
   Original Code or Covered Code other than with the prior written consent of
   Sybase or the Contributor, as applicable.

   (( 11. ))??
   Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and
   interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on
   behalf of Sybase ("Sybase Modifications"), and such Sybase Modifications will
   not be automatically subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole
   discretion, choose to license such Sybase Modifications under this License,
   or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not
   to license them at all.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of
         this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
         aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of
         this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as
         a cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code that have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
      of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in
      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
      Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or among you, Sybase or any Contributor, and You will not
      represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance
      or otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase's or
      any Contributor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop
      for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
      same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications,
      Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market
      or distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause
applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigè que le
prèsent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rèdiès en anglais.

(( Yahoo! Public License, Version 1.0 (YPL) ))??

This Yahoo! Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its
principal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089
("Yahoo!") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software").
By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the
terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of Copyright License

      (( 1.1 ))??
      - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby
      grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the
      Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy,
      modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or
      abridgement of the Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any
      file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the
      Software is not a "Modification."

      (( 1.2 ))??
      - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other
      entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your
      having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement.
      Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not
      considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

      (( 1.3 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code
      format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You
      must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution.
      With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the
      terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms
      apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are
      distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You "stand in the shoes"
      of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and
      conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You "stand in the shoes" of Yahoo!,
      You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which
      requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the
      jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.

      (( 1.4 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or
      object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the
      Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy
      of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
      compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
      provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In
      addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying
      to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are
      offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not
      restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the
      Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source
      code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.

      (( 1.5 ))??
      - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
      entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the
      Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.

   (( 2. ))??
   Support

   Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You.
   Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You
   for any other edition of the Software.

   (( 3. ))??
   Intellectual Property Rights

      (( 3.1 ))??
      - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
      no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
      to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel
      or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that
      are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
      retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as
      they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
      notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user
      interface of the Software.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
      trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

   (( 4. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranties

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO!
   MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR
   RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
   SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO
   THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF
   YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT
   TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE
   FOREGOING.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA,
   COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
   FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT,
   INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 6. ))??
   Term and Termination

      (( 6.1 ))??
      - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated
      earlier pursuant to this Section 6.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this Agreement,
      Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.

      (( 6.3 ))??
      - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
      this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies
      available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement.

      (( 6.4 ))??
      - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
      reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting
      Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or
      Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of
      this Agreement.

   (( 7. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
   the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
   communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral
   or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. The
   relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and
   this Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
   joint venture or any other form of legal association between the parties. If
   any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid,
   unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in
   a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such
   invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining
   terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and
   enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be
   interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
   California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of
   law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
   of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this
   Agreement involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the
   jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with
   venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
   obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by
   You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including
   by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written
   consent of Yahoo!, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer

Yahoo! Public License v1.1
https://spdx.org/licenses/YPL-1.1.json
http://www.zimbra.com/license/yahoo_public_license_1.1.html
**//

(( Yahoo! Public License, Version 1.1 (YPL) ))??

This Yahoo! Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its
principal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089
("Yahoo!") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software").
By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the
terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of Copyright License

      (( 1.1 ))??
      - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby
      grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the
      Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy,
      modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or
      abridgement of the Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any
      file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the
      Software is not a "Modification."

      (( 1.2 ))??
      - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other
      entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your
      having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement.
      Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not
      considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

      (( 1.3 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code
      format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You
      must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution.
      With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the
      terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms
      apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are
      distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You "stand in the shoes"
      of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and
      conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You "stand in the shoes" of Yahoo!,
      You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which
      requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the
      jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.

      (( 1.4 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or
      object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the
      Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy
      of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
      compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
      provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In
      addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying
      to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are
      offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not
      restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the
      Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source
      code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.

      (( 1.5 ))??
      - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
      entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the
      Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.

   (( 2. ))??
   Support

   Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You.
   Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You
   for any other edition of the Software.

   (( 3. ))??
   Intellectual Property Rights

      (( 3.1 ))??
      - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
      no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
      to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel
      or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that
      are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
      retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as
      they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
      notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user
      interface of the Software.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
      trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

   (( 4. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranties

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO!
   MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR
   RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
   SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO
   THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF
   YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT
   TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE
   FOREGOING.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA,
   COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
   FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT,
   INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 6. ))??
   Term and Termination

      (( 6.1 ))??
      - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated
      earlier pursuant to this Section 6.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement, Yahoo! may
      terminate this Agreement.

      (( 6.3 ))??
      - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
      this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies
      available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement.

      (( 6.4 ))??
      - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
      reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting
      Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or
      Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of
      this Agreement.

   (( 7. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
   the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
   communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral
   or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. The
   relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and
   this Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
   joint venture or any other form of legal association between the parties. If
   any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid,
   unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in
   a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such
   invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining
   terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and
   enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be
   interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
   California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of
   law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
   of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this
   Agreement involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the
   jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with
   venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
   obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by
   You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including
   by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written
   consent of Yahoo!, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer
   without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of
   this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must
   be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to
   enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any
   time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's
   rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of
   the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to
   take subsequent action.

(( Zimbra Public License, Version 1.3 (ZPL) ))??

This Zimbra Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
describes the terms under which VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its
principal place of business at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304
("VMware") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software").
By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the
terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of Copyright License

      (( 1.1 - ))??
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby
      grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the
      Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy,
      modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or
      abridgement of the Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any
      file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the
      Software is not a "Modification."

      (( 1.2 - ))??
      If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other
      entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your
      having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement.
      Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not
      considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

      include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With
      respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the

      distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You "stand in the shoes"
      of VMware in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and
      conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You "stand in the shoes" of VMware,
      You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which
      requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the
      jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.

      (( 1.4 - ))??
      For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object
      code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software

      recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the Software
      granted by VMware under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any
      Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.

      This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
      entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the
      Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.

   (( 2. ))??
   Support

   VMware has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You.
   Nothing in this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You
   for any other edition of the Software.

   (( 3. ))??
   Intellectual Property Rights

      (( 3.1 - ))??
      Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
      no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
      to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel
      or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that
      are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.

      (( 3.2 - ))??
      In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
      retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as
      they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
      notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user

   FOREGOING.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA,
   COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
   FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT,

      this Agreement.

      (( 6.3 - ))??
      All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
      this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies
      available to VMware at law or equity or under this Agreement.

      (( 6.4 - ))??
      Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
      reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting

   Miscellaneous

   This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
   the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
   communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral
   or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. The
   relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and
   this Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
   joint venture or any other form of legal association between the parties. If
   any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid,
   unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in
   a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such
   invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining
   terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and
   enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be
   interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
   California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of
   law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
   of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this
   Agreement involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the
   jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with
   venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
   obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by
   You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including
   by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written
   consent of VMware, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer
   without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of
   this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must
   be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to
   enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any
   time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's
   rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of
   the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to
   take subsequent action.

Zimbra Public License v1.4

**//

(( Zimbra Public License, Version 1.4 (ZPL) ))??

This Zimbra Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
describes the terms under which Zimbra, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Zimbra")
will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software"). By using
the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the terms of this
Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of Copyright License

      (( 1.1 ))??
      - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zimbra hereby
      grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the
      Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy,
      modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or
      abridgement of the Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any
      file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the
      Software is not a "Modification."

      (( 1.2 ))??
      - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other
      entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your
      having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement.
      Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not
      considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

      (( 1.3 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code
      format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You
      must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution.
      With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the
      terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms
      apply to Zimbra with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are
      distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You "stand in the shoes"
      of Zimbra in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and
      conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You "stand in the shoes" of Zimbra,
      You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which
      requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the
      jurisdiction of federal or state courts of Northern Texas.

      (( 1.4 ))??
      - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or
      object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the
      Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy
      of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
      compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
      provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In
      addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying
      to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are
      offered by You alone and not by Zimbra, and that such license does not
      restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the
      Software granted by Zimbra under this Agreement or rights in the source
      code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.

      (( 1.5 ))??
      - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
      entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the
      Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.

   (( 2. ))??
   Support

   Zimbra has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You.
   Nothing in this Agreement requires Zimbra to enter into any license with You
   for any other edition of the Software.

   (( 3. ))??
   Intellectual Property Rights

      (( 3.1 - ))??
      Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
      no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
      to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel
      or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that
      are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.

      (( 3.2 - ))??
      In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
      retain and reproduce any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as
      they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
      notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user
      interface of the Software.

      (( 3.3 - ))??
      This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
      trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

   (( 4. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranties

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ZIMBRA
   MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, REGARDING OR
   RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, ZIMBRA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
   SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO
   THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ZIMBRA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF
   ZIMBRA HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT
   TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF
   THE FOREGOING.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT WILL ZIMBRA BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA,
   AND COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
   FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE, OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT,
   INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF ZIMBRA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 6. ))??
   Term and Termination

      (( 6.1 - ))??
      This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated earlier
      pursuant to this Section 6.

      (( 6.2 - ))??
      In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement, Zimbra may terminate
      this Agreement.

      (( 6.3 - ))??
      All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
      this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies
      available to Zimbra at law or equity or under this Agreement.

      (( 6.4 - ))??
      Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
      reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting
      Zimbra's liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6), or
      Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of
      this Agreement.

   (( 7. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
   the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
   communications, representations, understandings, and agreements, either oral

   (( 1. ))??
   License Grants; No Trademark License

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

      (( a) ))??
      A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
      license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly
      perform and publicly display My Work.

      (( b) ))??
      A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for
      sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service marks,
   or logos.

   (( 2. ))??
   Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform recipients how
   they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable
   conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices
   contained in My Work (to the extent they remain pertinent). "Legal Notices"
   means copyright notices, license notices, license texts, and author
   attributions, but does not include logos, other graphical images, trademarks
   or trademark legends.

   (( 3. ))??
   Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived Work as
   a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such licensing. This
   condition may not be avoided through such means as separate Distribution of
   portions of the Derived Work. You may additionally license the Derived Work
   under the GPL, so that the recipient may further Distribute the Derived Work
   under either this License or the GPL.

   (( 4. ))??
   Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further restrictions on
   the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under this License. This
   condition is not excused merely because such restrictions result from Your
   compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as
   a court order or an agreement with a third party).

   However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material governed by
   a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of
   this License, provided that Your Distribution complies with such other
   license.

   (( 5. ))??
   Conditions for Distributing Object Code

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that you
   accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding Source
   is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary means of
   providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible storage
   medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available through such
   URL for two years from the date of Your most recent Distribution of the
   Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product itself contains or is
   accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made available in a customarily
   accessible manner), You need not also comply with the first paragraph of this
   section.

   Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party
   beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right to
   enforce its terms.

   (( 6. ))??
   Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or modification
   of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing terms apply to the
   Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to the extent of Your
   copyright in the Patch. This condition does not negate the other conditions
   of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

   (( 7. ))??
   Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a
   license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
   License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next
   Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to
   the conditions in sections 2 through 5.

   (( 8. ))??
   Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 2 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen years
   have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work under this
   License.

   (( 9. ))??
   Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

   (( 10. ))??
   Termination

   Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

      (( a) ))??
      fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure such
      noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

      (( b) ))??
      initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims) alleging that any part
      of My Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent.

   Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered Works You
   subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the rights of those who
   have received copies or rights from You subject to this License.

   To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary merely
   for running it, such permission is not terminable.

   (( 11. ))??
   Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions"). Unless I
   explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under Later
   Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version.

   (( 12. ))??
   No Warranty

   My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk of using it.
   To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Distributor of My Work
   excludes the implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
   particular purpose and non-infringement.

   (( 13. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any Distributor
   of My Work be liable to You for any damages whatsoever, whether direct,
   indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether arising
   under contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the
   Distributor knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.

   (( 14. ))??
   Severability

   The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License does not
   affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License. Such
   provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid
   and enforceable.

   (( 15. ))??

      license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for
      sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service marks,
   or logos.

   (( 2. ))??
   Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform recipients how
   they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable
   conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices
   contained in My Work (to the extent they remain pertinent). "Legal Notices"
   means copyright notices, license notices, license texts, and author
   attributions, but does not include logos, other graphical images, trademarks
   or trademark legends.

   (( 3. ))??
   Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived Work as
   a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such licensing. This
   condition may not be avoided through such means as separate Distribution of
   portions of the Derived Work.

   If the Derived Work includes material licensed under the GPL, You may instead
   license the Derived Work under the GPL.

   (( 4. ))??
   Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further restrictions on
   the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under this License. This
   condition is not excused merely because such restrictions result from Your
   compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as
   a court order or an agreement with a third party).

   However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material governed by
   a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of
   this License, provided that compliance with such other license would not
   conflict with any conditions stated in other sections of this License.

   (( 5. ))??
   Conditions for Distributing Object Code

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that you
   accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding Source
   is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary means of
   providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible storage
   medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available through such
   URL for two years from the date of Your most recent Distribution of the
   Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product itself contains or is
   accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made available in a customarily
   accessible manner), You need not also comply with the first paragraph of this
   section.

   Each direct and indirect recipient of the Covered Work from You is an
   intended third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5,
   with the right to enforce its terms.

   (( 6. ))??
   Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or modification
   of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing terms apply to the
   Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to the extent of Your
   copyright in the Patch. This condition does not negate the other conditions
   of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

   (( 7. ))??
   Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a
   license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
   License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next
   Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to
   the conditions in sections 3 through 5.

   (( 8. ))??
   Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 3 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen years
   have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work under this
   License.

   (( 9. ))??
   Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

   (( 10. ))??
   Termination

   Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

      (( a) ))??
      fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure such
      noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

      (( b) ))??
      initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims) alleging that any part
      of My Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent.

   Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered Works You
   subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the rights of those who
   have received copies or rights from You subject to this License.

   To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary merely
   for running it, such permission is not terminable.

   (( 11. ))??
   Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions"). Unless I
   explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under Later
   Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version.

   (( 12. ))??
   No Warranty

   My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk of using it.
   To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Distributor of My Work
   excludes the implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
   particular purpose and non-infringement.

   (( 13. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any Distributor
   of My Work be liable to You for any damages whatsoever, whether direct,
   indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether arising
   under contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the
   Distributor knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.

   (( 14. ))??
   Severability

   The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License does not
   affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License. Such
   provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid
   and enforceable.

   (( 15. ))??

présente licence, à des fins commerciales ou non, dans le monde entier et pour
une durée illimitée, dans les conditions exprimées ci-dessous.

Le « Réutilisateur » est libre de réutiliser l'« Information » :

   -
   de la reproduire, la copier,

   -
   de l'adapter, la modifier, l'extraire et la transformer, pour créer des «
   Informations dérivées », des produits ou des services,

   de la communiquer, la diffuser, la redistribuer, la publier et la

   mentionner la paternité de l'« Information » : sa source (au moins le nom
   du « Concédant ») et la date de dernière mise à jour de l'« Information
   » réutilisée.

Le « Réutilisateur » peut notamment s'acquitter de cette condition en
renvoyant, par un lien hypertexte, vers la source de « l'Information » et
assurant une mention effective de sa paternité.

Par exemple :

« Ministère de xxx - Données originales téléchargées sur
http:/www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/xxx/, mise à jour du 14 février 2017 ».

Cette mention de paternité ne confère aucun caractère officiel à la «
Réutilisation » de l'« Information », et ne doit pas suggérer une
quelconque reconnaissance ou caution par le « Concédant », ou par toute autre
entité publique, du « Réutilisateur » ou de sa « Réutilisation ».

« DONNÉES À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL »

L'« Information » mise à disposition peut contenir des « Données à
caractère personnel » pouvant faire l'objet d'une « Réutilisation ». Si tel
est le cas, le « Concédant » informe le « Réutilisateur » de leur
présence.

L'« Information » peut être librement réutilisée, dans le cadre des droits
accordés par la présente licence, à condition de respecter le cadre légal
relatif à la protection des données à caractère personnel.

« DROITS DE PROPRIÉTÉ INTELLECTUELLE »

Il est garanti au « Réutilisateur » que les éventuels « Droits de
propriété intellectuelle » détenus par des tiers ou par le « Concédant »

présente licence.

Lorsque le « Concédant » détient des « Droits de propriété intellectuelle
» cessibles sur l'« Information », il les cède au « Réutilisateur » de
façon non exclusive, à titre gracieux, pour le monde entier, pour toute la
durée des « Droits de propriété intellectuelle », et le « Réutilisateur
» peut faire tout usage de l'« Information » conformément aux libertés et
aux conditions définies par la présente licence.

RESPONSABILITÉ

L'« Information » est mise à disposition telle que produite ou reçue par le
« Concédant », sans autre garantie expresse ou tacite que celles prévues par
la présente licence. L'absence de défauts ou d'erreurs éventuellement
contenues dans l'« Information », comme la fourniture continue de l'«
Information » n'est pas garantie par le « Concédant ». Il ne peut être tenu
pour responsable de toute perte, préjudice ou dommage de quelque sorte causé
à des tiers du fait de la « Réutilisation ».

Le « Réutilisateur » est seul responsable de la « Réutilisation » de l'«
Information ».

La « Réutilisation » ne doit pas induire en erreur des tiers quant au contenu
de l'« Information », sa source et sa date de mise à jour.

DROIT APPLICABLE

Cette licence est la version 2.0 de la Licence Ouverte.

Etalab se réserve la faculté de proposer de nouvelles versions de la Licence
Ouverte. Cependant, les « Réutilisateurs » pourront continuer à réutiliser
les informations qu'ils ont obtenues sous cette licence s'ils le souhaitent.

         (( c ))??

         (( (d) ))??

   (( 3 ))??
   DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification created by You
      //** shall **//
      __5__
      be provided to the Initial Developer in Source Code form and are subject
      to the terms of the License.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
         Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
         which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
         also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable
      versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce
      the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials
      provided with the product.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

      (( 3.8. ))??
      Restrictions.

      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary
      notices or labels from gSOAP.

   (( 4 ))??
   INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5 ))??
   APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6 ))??
   VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
      to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that you license differs from this License) and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains
      terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of
      the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   (( 7 ))??

   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9 ))??

   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR

   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Modifications: Version: 2.1.8.7-current Copyright 1998-2001 by Rob Braun

Sensor Addition Version: 2.1.8.9pre14a Copyright 2001 by Steve Grubb

This is an exerpt from an email I recieved from the original author, allowing
xinetd as maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified in the
copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string for future xinetd
versions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that
would only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the
confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.
